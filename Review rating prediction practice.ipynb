       "        \"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?\",\n",

You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint\\'s award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed \"offline\" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.

It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?\"),\n",

You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint\\'s award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed \"offline\" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.

The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.\"),\n",

Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.\"),\n",

       "  \"Worth paying more for something else. I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.\"),\n",

It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket.

When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I\\'ve had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn\\'t even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don\\'t have service, you don\\'t get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end.

This phone is perfect for someone who doesn\\'t need a camera, videos, bell and whistles stuff, but wants a sturdy reliable phone with a long battery life. It is also very inexpensive. Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a \"TERMINATOR\" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm. I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting. The only complaint I would make is that entering new contacts into the address book is somewhat difficult and counter-intuitive until you learn how to do it. You won\\'t regret buying this phone.'),\n",

       "  \"Solid phone Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2 one for an emergency replacement.\"),\n",

       "  \"Great disposible phone? I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.\"),\n",

       "  'STEEL. NOKIA STEEL. Over the past decade I have been through half a dozen cell phones. With a brief (and unsatisfactory) PANASONIC interlude, I have always gone NOKIA and did not regret it. My previous phone was NOKIA 6230i, a stylish working horse that, after three years of non-stop use, lately kept having ringer failure. I loved my phone and, although realized its time was up, did not want to have to familiarize myself with a whole different Menu SetUp. The NOKIA 6500-SLIDER was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful and robust brushed-steel finish, a large screen of impressive quality and one of the best phone cameras available (a 3.2Mpixels sensor behind an autofocus Carl Zeiss lens with flash). An important detail: the brushed steel is NOT that sensitive to fingerprint marks and will not require the constant wiping that other metal models do. The menu is intuitive and easy to use even if new to NOKIA 6-series. The buttons are large enough for adult fingers and, important for a slider phone, even the top buttons are fully accessible. Like most NOKIAs, the phone is greatly customizable, from colors and sounds to wallpapers and screensavers. It is robustly built and the slider glides easily in place with zero wobbling. NOKIA 6500-SLIDER is a beautiful phone that can be your helper for years. My only complaints are actually...three: (1) the very limited OnBoard memory (it has only 20MB - when my older 6230i had almost double that). Since only mp3s and photos stored on the Phone memory are guarantied to work when used as ring-tones or contact/group images, to have a cavernous 256MB Memory Card yet a puny 20MB OnBoard capacity seems ironic. (2) the placement of the speakerphone in the...back of the phone. Activate it and the phone speaks to your desk, voices coming out all muffled; and (3) the absence of photo stabilization. It may seem excessive for a phone, however when increasing the pixel number beyond 3M, image stabilization is actually essential if photos of any value are to be taken. All in all, an excellent stylish phone that, (six months after its initial release) should be available at bargain prices.'),\n",

It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar.

The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other \"basic\" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone\\'s features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

       "  'Good basic phone for the money I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I\\'m calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I\\'m on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a \"+\" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example \"+15551212121\" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics.'),\n",

It just keeps on working. No cracks or breaks. This thing has been dropped on cement more than once!! I just quit using it a week ago because I wasn't getting text messages sent from newer phones. It would come through as unreadable with the numbers 11001010 or something similar and I couldn't see who it was from either (if anyone knows how to remedy this, please tell me so I can go back to using this one!). This is my favorite phone. I also have a Samsung SGH-S425G and most recently added the Samsung Galaxy Stardust (all through Tracfone). The reason I like this Nokia 1100---I can text without ever looking at it because of the raised buttons. People with smart phones like to tell me that their phone has word prediction, which is when I get to tell them that this one does too! (Just gotta read the manual to see how to press the buttons once while spelling to get a list of suggested words). My smart phone takes me longer to do everything because it has too much stuff on it. With this one, I can make a call with 3 button presses, maybe 2. Not so on newer phones with more menus. If it weren't for needing to get text messages (work), I'd totally still be using this phone!!!!!\"),\n",

Only problem was when I went to port the second number, apparently I couldn't do it with the same SIM because the account had already been activated, then deactivated post-porting to Google Voice. However, Tracfone customer service (foreign call center), after troubleshooting on another phone call with me for 45 minutes finally agreed to send me a new SIM card (took 9 days to receive) and then I could activate again and port the 2nd number. The second time, I decided to give the phone to my son after porting, and called customer service and this time they were able to re-activate on the same 2nd SIM that had just finished the same procedure the first SIM did.

       "  'Best one yet - except for browser My wife and I each have one of this model Tracfone. Neither has been a problem with outgoing or incoming calls. No dropped calls. Voice quality has been clear and natural sounding. We haven\\'t yet found any areas where the phone won\\'t work, and this covers New England to Oregon. Those are the \"pros.\" The following are the \"cons,\" along with some physical features we would like to see improved: - One of my biggest cons is the fact that the browser key is fixed and cannot be changed or disabled. The prompt that gets you into this limited browser can be easily activated and cost you fractions of minutes. - I carry my T301G sideways in a belt holder. I have occasionally missed a call when extracting the phone and quickly pressing the \"off\" button by mistake. This won\\'t shut the phone off, but it will cancel the incoming call. - The little, raised line under the display is used to slide the phone open. This line is too small and and just about useless to use. A rubber, or ribbed area on the side of the phone would be much more useful to slide the phone up. I find the process to be a \"two thumbs\" operation if you don\\'t want to press on the LED display all the time - or activate one of the soft keys which are much too close. - My previous Tracfone was a \"clamshell\" V176. This has a rubber feel to the phone, and I never thought I might drop the thing because of a slick, or slippery exterior. I wish the T301G was made from the same material - although I have not yet dropped this phone. - The four soft keys can be programmed for whatever you want. I have found that assigning your \"contact list,\" messages, list of incoming calls and phone info (minutes and time left) works best for me. The keys themselves, however, are still too small. The \"incoming calls\" one is needed for when I mistakenly disconnect a call as mentioned above. - I found the phone information that constantly scrolls across the screen to be distracting and irritating. I was able to shut this function off through the menu though. The press of one of the soft keys now tells me this information. The above \"cons\" are not a deal breaker for me. Life with this phone would be just a little easier if they were addressed. Some other thoughts: - I have never had trouble adding minutes to either phone. I do it over the internet. All they want is your phone number (as long as the phone is registered with Tracfone - easy to do). You purchase the minutes/time and they appear on the phone almost immediately. Keep the phone \"on\" while doing this. - My V176 lasted almost six years with no problems until the last two weeks of it\\'s life. If I can get this same performance from the T301G, then (for the price)I think it will be worth it. - I know it would make the phone a bit larger, but I wish the soft keys, menu and browser keys, and key pad itself were a little larger. Less room for error and more comfortable to use. - I have the phone set to answer (or call) when the slide is used. I don\\'t think the browser will activate, by accident, when the phone is closed, because it\\'s locked then. (Edit on the above - If the phone is \"on,\" then the browser will activate even when the phone closed (locked). This \"con\" continues to grow larger) Not a great camera, but it will do in a pinch. The volume control is on the side of the phone. Ascending from 1 thru 7. One press below 1 puts the phone on vibrate. Easy. All-in-all, this is a nice little phone, for the price, and the fact that no contracts are involved. Much less expensive to operate than than most any other phone. It would, (at least for me) be the perfect little phone if the above \"cons\" could be ironed out. __________________________________ March, 2014 -I have to add these thoughts to the above review. It\\'s been just about four years since I wrote the above comments. The necessity of opening the phone by placing a thumb on the screen has not been a problem at all. The rugged little screen is no worse for the constant manipulation. My wife and I were up in mid-Maine last May. I had my new Apple iPhone with me. Three of the others I was with had iPhones and one android phone. It was necessary to call a person at the local historical society. These four \"high end\" phones got \"no service\" in this remote area. I remembered that I had the Tracfone in the glove compartment, because I still had a couple of months of time left on the phone. Yes - you guessed it - the Samsung T301G made this call just fine. No, the T301G doesn\\'t take really clear photos and it\\'s difficult to send a text or record appointments. But, it was the only device (out of five) that actually made a telephone call! You know I put another year on the T301G and have it with me when I need to travel to these out-of-the-way places. I can now add \"dependable\" to the list of positive comments above. I don\\'t know why the Tracfone was the only one able to make the important call - I just know that it did.

       "  \"Browser button will eat away your minutes Just had to add my two cents. I read the reviews about the ease of accidentally hitting the browser button and losing minutes, and I ordered this phone anyway. And I agree 100% about the browser. While setting up the phone I have lost a few minutes already by accidentally hitting the darn browser key. What a dumb place to put a browser key! (It's the top right button on the front of the phone, and if you bump it, hit it, press it accidentally (even when the phone is in the closed position), if your phone is on, you will lose 0.5 minutes. I have searched all over the web and there is no way to disable it, or at least have it ask you if you want to connect. Terrible terrible feature. I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and entered *#4777*8665# and followed the instructions, and it doesn't work for me, and from other sites I have found out, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am going to see over the next month how much time I lose, and then I may have to take another reviewer's advice from another website and glue the button shut. (He said this worked for him fine and you can still get to the browser from the menu button). I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who has kids, your kids will drain their minutes by accident.\"),\n",

The features are great and even though the internet access was a bit shaky and slow, that didn't matter to me since I didn't use it much for that purpose anyway. The coolest thing about this phone is I was helping my brother pull his boat up next to a dock and the phone slipped out of my pocket and into the water. Even though I only paid twenty bucks for it, new, I also had some 300 minutes on it and also some pictures I took, so I was dissapointed I would lose them both. I just looked at the phone sitting there on the sand, and even though I knew there wasn't much chance for it, I stretched my hand down as far as I could and retrieved the phone. The window lit up when I shook the water from it. My brother said I would have to take it apart right away and dry everything as quickly as possible. I wasn't sure how to take it apart, and didn't have any tools, but it was still working, so I figured it might be okay. Later the screen wouldn't come on, and I thought it was done. An hour or two later, the screen began to work again, but the key pad wouldn't work. A couple of hours later, the keypad began working again, and everything was fine. It has been fine ever since and that was over a week ago. The only thing I don't like is that the only way to retreive the pictures is to send them via e-mail to the computer. It does offer double minutes, so I figure it is still worth it. Now I get a kick out of using it knowing it laid on the sand under two feet of water and still works great.\"),\n",

       "  \"WORST PHONE EVER, Short Battery Life, No Bluetooth, ETC UPDATE: December 8, 2011 In the past year, I have gone through 3 of these phones. Based on that, the Samsung T301G has got to be one of the worst phones ever made. The main problem is that when the phone breaks, Tracfone sends out a REFURBISHED one. The refurbs were probably returned for the same reason as I returned my first phone (it was freezing and finally became unresponsive). After I called to ask that they send me a new phone, they said OK but they again sent a used one. I'm only going to activate it because most of their other phones have also gotten bad reviews. I picked this Tracfone after my Motorola broke after 2 years of use. This phone has very, very short batter life (needs to be charged every other day even if it hasn't been used very much) and it's Bluetooth function does NOT work with my Bluetooth enabled GPS and other devices for hands-free calling. The only positive is that the phone looks better than the Motorola and that it's faster at sending/receiving text messages, even though the controls and buttons to type the text are very small and hard to get used to. To sum it all up, if you can, please buy a different phone and save yourself the headache of having a broken phone every 3 months (and that's in the case of a NEW one. Used/Refurbished ones are broken OUT OF THE BOX). Tracfone used to be good, but with this, one of the worst phones ever made, and the fact that they keep sending me a used one makes them one of the most annoying companies I've had to deal with.\"),\n",

I'm not a heavy cell phone user so prepaids are great for me. Why a got a second phone is a long, boring story. The bottom line is when this Samsung is immediately next to my Motorola in my home, it has sometimes has only 2 bars while my Motorola has four. I've had it in areas where there is generally excellent cell coverage where it has no reception/signal at all while my Motorola (again, immediately next to the Samsung) has four bars and is working fine. I have gotten nowhere near the standby battery life that is cited on Tracfone's product description. Most of my conversations are in the 1-3 minute range. Most days I make fewer than three calls. I can't imagine how short the battery life would be if I actually used it to talk for any period of time. Even fully charged at the beginning of the day the battery shows as low by the end of the day or the next AM. While there are some nice features (being able to assign ring tones to contacts) that my older phone doesn't have, those features are worthless if I can't make calls or the battery is dead or dying.\"),\n",

       "  'Bluetooth works with Ford Sync, do not count on support Tracfone still has the best geographic coverage of the pay as you go cell phone options. I had tried a Common Cents option when I wanted to upgrade to a phone with Bluetooth capabilities to work with a newly acquired car and bought in to the Common Cents hype about lower per minute cost and the round down on partial minutes of airtime. What Common Cents does not emphasize in their advertising is that there is absolutely no roaming. If you are outside of the Sprint network coverage area the phone will not work. Just because you have a friend or acquaintance with a Sprint Contract phone that gets coverage in the areas that you travel does not ensure that a Common Cents phone will work in those areas. I subsequently upgraded my Tracfone to the Samsung t301g which did pair with my Ford Sync system and allows hand free calling. I was unable to get the contact list from the phone uploaded to the Sync system but Ford does have some free downloadable software that allows you to create a contact list on your computer and then transfer it to the vehicle via a USB data key. The phone documentation is minimal and the download available from TracFone adds very little information. The default ringtone is progressive, starts out soft and gets louder, and I doubt that anyone will hear the first two rings in a store, restaurant or car. There are several other ringtones built in and I found one that was satisfactory when the volume is adjusted upward. The call volume is also adjustable during a call and most people will probably need to set it near the maximum for use with the hands free calling options with Ford Sync. One peculiarity of the phone is that there is no provision for setting the date and time manually and the time picked up from the network is about two minutes slow. I initiated a support request via email and one week, four emails and about 2 hours spent on the phone with three \"customer support\" representatives I finally received an email confirming that there was no way to manually adjust the time, that they could do nothing about the incorrect (Compared to NIST)time, and stating that the \"issue had been addressed\", which in my opinion is not the same as the issue being resolved. While the \"Customer Support\" representative were courteous, they speak a dialect that is difficult to understand and one every call you spend at least five minutes repeating information that you provided in you initial support request and all of your previous calls and then long periods on hold as they \"check with a supervisor\" or search \"their system\" for additional information regarding your problem. In summary the phone is usable and does provide some functionality with Ford Sync systems at a reasonable price when you factor in that you get double minutes for the life of the phone. TracFone support is basically non-existent. If you are the type that reads manuals and are willing to do some internet research Tracfone provides \"as needed airtime\" at a reasonable cost. If you are the type that likes or needs some hand holding you should probably look elsewhere and if you have become dependent on a cell phone to provide the correct time you definitely need a different phone.'),\n",

Perhaps Samsung fixed this issue. 2) The screen is 2\" diagonal, which is a good size for a low end phone, however the low resolution makes it a bit grainy. Also it has a narrow viewing angle, i.e. you have to hold it at a certain angle or it appears dark or washed out. 3) The mobile web capability is very limited because of the phone\\'s low memory. Originally Tracfone only allowed you to go to a set of preselected sites. Now you can enter any URL, but most of the time you get an insufficent memory error because the site is too large. I mainly use it to get info. by searching Google, in lieu of the Google SMS service that they discontinued. 4) As others have noted, when you close the slider the outer buttons don\\'t lock immediately, you have to wait a few seconds before putting it in your pocket, otherwise the browser button could get pushed and you can lose a lot of minutes. 5) Battery standby time is less than a week, which is lower than other phones I\\'ve used. On the other hand it recharges faster than usual. EDIT: I recently charged the phone on a Sunday night, and it lasted until the next Monday morning, with light usage during the week. It will stay at one battery bar for a while and still be functional. When you recharge it, there doesn\\'t seem to be any alert when it is finished, you have to just see if the battery icon is full. 6) The menu screens have a black and orange color scheme which, while readable, is a bit odd. I got it when it was $8, from Dealathon, and I\\'m still using it. Overall I\\'d say it is worth the current price of $5, for those of us who are not into the complexity and cost of smartphones. You can upgrade to another Tracfone later on. You can connect it to your Windows PC using a free program from Samsung and a cable you can get from Amazon for a few dollars, see this thread on the Howard forum: [...] ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unlike some of their other phones, Samsung doesn\\'t provide a PDF booklet/manual for this phone.

This is how: Open the slider and type *#4777*8665# and a menu should pop up. Go to menu number 5, Attach Mode. Select Manual attach. OK. It will inform you that you need to restart the phone for this to take effect - do this later. Then go to menu number 2, GPRS detach. The phone will notify you that it has done the GPRS detach, which means that it is no longer connected to the GPRS network. Now restart the phone, and there should be a blue and white G at the top of the screen instead of a red and white one. Success! Of course, you may reverse this at any time by going back to the secret menu and selecting Auto attach and GPRS attach. This will NOT adversely affect your ability to add minutes to the phone via [...] or by using a minutes card purchased in a store. If blocking the browser makes you unable to add minutes directly from the phone, just GPRS attach again and you'll be fine.

When I complained was told several times by the first two women that the phone was working properly and they did their best to dismiss me. So, I asked if they were calling me a liar. Finally they decided to send me a new, different brand of phone. What irks me about this entire situation is, you KNOW they KNEW what was happening to me, yet feigned ignorance. After I told them I had been a faithful tracfone user for eight years and did not have this problem with my other phone, did their attitude change a bit. Still very upset the way they treated me, but it is typical of the way companies treat their customers these days. AT&T is worse, much worse. If I had a choice I would change. In fact, I felt like just giving up all this technology and doing without a cell phone. How much do we have to pay to be treated like garbage? Tracfone you are the pits today. It's terrible to waste so much time talking to these people, even if in the end they do what is right. I know I was on the phone way over an hour.

My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing). Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down! Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction. The 376 has a \"flimsy\" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily. The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear. Samsung produced some features you don\\'t see in the average \"prepay plan phones.\" The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors). They\\'ll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.'),\n",

The simple fix is to wait about five seconds for the screen to go blank before placing the phone in the holster. This locks the keys until you press unlock then OK or slide the phone open.

So, you cannot use your own plug-in headset or a universal external extended battery, and there are no OEM extended batteries w/cover. I was told by a dealer that post 2008 phones must have compatible micro or mini jacks, and T301g is older. If this is not an issue for you, the phone is a very good simple phone, especially once the browser is disabled. These are problems for me, and may be for you: 1. microphone quality of provided headset is significantly lower than the Plantronics I was using; 2.

First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery.

Bought a new charger (now we;\\'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It\\'s used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone\\'s failure to even operate in basic mode. I\\'ve got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be \"refurbished\" and fully functional.

We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I \"upgraded\" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn\\'t want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn\\'t like their current non-smart phones. I\\'m guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don\\'t use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon\\'s better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn\\'t upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from \"Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)\" to \"Legacy/unsupported phone. Don\\'t waste your time to try again\". If I didn\\'t see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn\\'t see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online \"upgrade/replacement\" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn\\'t think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn\\'t want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don\\'t have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon\\'s GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.'),\n",

I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.\"),\n",

This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It\\'s not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn\\'t the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I\\'m rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn\\'t for everyone; it has none of the smartphone \"flair\" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn\\'t lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.'),\n",

It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use \"genuine\" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn\\'t have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than.

I had to pray over it to get it to last the additional year. I really did pray over it. The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

       "  'VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon\\'s support community forum site (search for \"Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..\"). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone\\'s Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon\\'s tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word\\'s spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon\\'s review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought.

I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible. (K.I.S.S.) These are OK phones and for emergencies it takes care of that requirement. The cell service itself is normal & adequate. Yes I would recommend it to anyone as an emergency phone.\"),\n",

After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the \"wrong battery\", \"unsupported battery\", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn\\'t arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they\\'d mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and \"*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired.\" and in a separate email, \"Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST.\" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by \"We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST\". A week later, I got another message, \"Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing\", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA.

The phone takes pictures also. Not the best but that is not what I purchased the phone for. This phone has all that I need to communicate with others via text or calling. I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it. What I also love about this phone is that I text over 1000 texts a month. I only pay $20.00 a month for a text bundle. I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what. I love the Samsung Smooth with the Verizon service. Never lose a call or miss one, I can text all day long, every day for only $20.00 a month, and all of the extras that I described above.

As such, I expect she will use the phone for a few days every couple of months. The payment plans available are extremely unfriendly for this purpose. All of the available plans are \"use it or lose it\" - minimum deposit is $15 monthly or $25 that expires in 3 months. When the billing period is up, AT&T eats all your unspent funds and you have to pump more into the account in order to use the phone again. There is NO option for people who want to pay only for time used. I suppose I shouldn\\'t be surprised by this, but the ATT reps are apparently coached to be dishonest when setting up the plans as well. I asked the rep I spoke with at least 3 times if there were any hidden fees or monthly minimums, and she said \"no\" three times. After making an additional deposit I get on the web site and learn about the \"expiration date\" on money deposited.

I have now been on a smartphone kick, progressing from the MB860 Atrix 4G to the MB865 Atrix 2 (This was actually a downgrade from the 4G unfortunately, it sucked) and now onto the MB886 Atrix HD. Back onto the subject oof the A107: Call quality was good-to-excellent: Never dropped a call, others heard me loud and clear, hearing them was loud and clear as well. If I recall, this does have a speakerphone through use of the ear receiver. Features were poor/lacking: It was able to call and text, I'm not sure I remember ever being able to connect to the internet on it however. I know it's not an HSPA/EVDO device (3G) but I should have still been able to pull up a single page on Google or Yahoo, however that was not capable even on the 1X data connection. Reliability was excellent: The phone still works to this very day, it's never bugged out on me or not turned on or made a call when I wanted & needed it to. Ruggedness was excellent: I am notorious for dropping my phones. I have dropped this thing numerous times but it functions perfect, the only thing apparent is the scuffs and marks on the outside of the case. Battery life was excellent: I remember using this phone for days with plenty of talk and text going on and not having to charge it very often at all. When I did charge it, I'd charge it overnight (8~hours) and use it until it was about dead again. It would last for days though, I am positive on that. *Not sure about if you're seeing this at the $27 price I am now, but I can honestly say I'd hold off on it for that price.

Details of this process are all over the web so I won't repeat them here. I didn't intend to really use it for calls which is a good thing because the phone is really cheap. This phone is almost unusable for voice calling. Don't get the idea that this is a good choice for anything but a backup to your backup phone used only if you were stranded on a desert island. I suppose it could be used by kids who mostly text since that part of the phone is pretty standard. Setup was simple following the instructions in the box. It did take at least 10 minutes to activate. it turns out to be only $0.10/min and $0.20/text. Probably heavy text users would go for one of the /day or /month plans.

No software available from Samsung, no iSync support - even from third parties, nothing from Google or Yahoo. (Please add a comment if you come across anything@) TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access. They'll warn you that this will also disable MMS (Picture/sound/video messaging) but since you can't send such messages anyway, this is probably not a big deal. **Now I don't have to worry about being charged every time I press the wrong button and it starts.** I use my Verizon MiFi with my MacBook Pro, iPod or iPad for mobile 'net access. Service: I recommend the $2/day plan. You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.) It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out. If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device. Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone. Cell Phone: The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy. It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system, No time-sucking learning curve. Final Word: I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months. Plus, you can buy $25 cards at a discount if you shop around. The phone serves my needs and I am very satisfied with it. But, smartphones are getting cheaper and cheaper...\"),\n",

These phones are very confusing to navigate and even the graphics feel like they are about five years behind the times.

It made noise like someone was calling when they weren't, it couldn't complete calls, and the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than about twelve hours without even using it. Because it was more than 30 days I would have to do a warranty replacement rather than exchange it. I decided that it wasn't even worth my time to warranty replace it since I didn't like the phone to begin with. Unless price is your only concern in buying a phone (it was my main concern when I bought this) I recommend paying a bit more and getting a better phone.

There is nothing you can really do on this phone, especially with respect to the internet that is interesting. As far as the craftsmanship goes, that is the reason for giving this phone 3 stars only, as one should totally forget about using this phone for the internet because it lacks the computing technology. Below is my old review: I Can't Speak More Highly of This Phone. I have tried more expensive phones, but this one is just right because I like a simple cell phone with internet capabilities. I love its almost only text browsing. That is, you will be able to view some pictures in color, but not with a great deal of clarity. I use my SGH-a107 for text email, text news (like NPR or CNN), and as an emergency phone. Usually, I spend about $25 on it every month, but if there is a $15 card, I can get away with spending that much. A 100MB package should do it for the first month, and then with rollover, you can buy less expensive internet packages. It is almost impossible to use up 100MB on this phone, and I use my internet daily for hours on end. Sometimes my hands are shaky, and that makes typing on one of those mini-keypads on the more expensive phones nearly impossible for me. Not only that, this phone fits in my hands well. That is, when I use other phones for hours on end, my thumbs hurt. However, with this phone, there is no pain. Once you get used to its typing features, typing a message on it is a snap!

I previously had T-Mobile prepaid but had to switch because I had no service in my house. After switching to AT&T, I can actually make calls/texts in my house. The service is quite cheap as well, I am on the Simple Rate plan. It costs $.10/min to talk which gets deducted from your prepaid balance. Standard texting costs $.25 per text, but I bought 200 messages for $4.99 that lasts for 30 days (Comes to $.02/text). Cell Phone: The phone was super cheap and yet it is quiet sturdy. There is no exterior screen, making it that much more stable/energy efficient. It is quite possibly the simplest phone you can buy new on the market. It does not have the capacitive touchscreen that you will find on an iPhone, it does not have an HD screen, nor does it let you scroll through the internet like you would on your computer. Instead, this phone lets you make calls and send/receive text messages. Crazy right? It is not made to be the shiny object that attracts the nearby fishes and sheep, it is simply a mobile phone for communicating. My only quip is that is has no volume control buttons on the side, not a huge issue, just something I would have liked. I also use the phone as my alarm to wake up. Final Word: I estimate that it will cost me about $10-15 a month for their service a month. I usually text a lot more than I make calls, but I spend no more than 100-150 minutes a month which equals $10-15. Now that I have the $4.99 texting package, I will probably reduce my minutes, making it go down to 50-10 minutes. The phone serves is purpose, I am very satisfied with it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a volume control button the side, it doesn't so I'll live without it but it is not perfect. It meets all my criteria of needs, nothing else to say.\"),\n",

It's not exactly fair to pick on a $9.99 phone but since all I expected were basic functions and this one failed to deliver, I thought I had to comment. Most importantly, the phone I purchased started to shut off by itself after a few months causing me to miss incoming calls and texts. Then, even when it was on, texts sent to me in the morning would show up late in the day, as would voice mail messages and missed call indicators. I ended up replacing the phone and all of these problems disappeared so I can't seem to fault my network provider.

Anyway what I wanted was a tough phone with 3G. (At&T doesn't have 2G in some parts of the country which I found out on our last motorcycle trip with my old RAZZ). My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue.

Tundra had been through 4 years of rough use including purposly throwing it on the floor when someone was bragging about their new smart phone. I wasn't impressed with the construction when I purchased it but had to have a replacement. The Rugby II was the toughest phone stocked at the store. The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections. IM is the only lockable internet ap in the Rugby II Tundra was able to usb connect to PC for data transfer. Rugby II has to have a mini sim card installed before it will even try.

I had 3 of them that broke inside of a year (from the *original* date of purchase, mind you). B/c of the false information AT&T gave me on multiple calls (5 calls!), I could not get a new, alternative brand phone. So, I was forced into The Rugby II. Well, I\\'m happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven\\'t had any dropped calls. I haven\\'t had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don\\'t seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it\\'s folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven\\'t found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they\\'ve been added. It\\'s bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I\\'m suddenly feeling lighter, I know I\\'ve left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn\\'t the phone you want. You\\'ll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven\\'t had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won\\'t SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they\\'re not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don\\'t know if there was a voice dial option, but it\\'s on the II. It\\'s just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don\\'t try to voice dial 911. You\\'ll die before the call\\'s been made (maybe I\\'m exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory\\'s decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more \"consumer-ized\" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. \"how does this damn thing work?\" \"Can\\'t you reboot it?\" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I\\'m getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I\\'ll review that soon, too. Potential Rugby II users: It\\'s not as super cool as other phones out there, but it\\'ll \\'git \\'er done.\\' Just be prepared to be patient. It\\'s NOT lightning fast.. Oh, and you still can\\'t read or reply to texts when you\\'re on a call, but you can send them. And that kind of defeats the purpose of texting.'),\n",

When that phone broke, we decided to try the newer Rugby II. After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn\\'t know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a \"Rugged\" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung.

The ever-reliable Nokia had served me faithfully for 7 full years when ATT determined that it couldn\\'t tolerate such superb service in its network. The planet\\'s largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a \"free\" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several \"free\" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, \"None,\" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a \"free\" phone, I\\'d need to buy the \"reliable\" model. 3. In \"upgrading\" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4. The PTT feature has been located such that it cannot be avoided--and which brings additional charges when used. (But this can be disabled. Pry out the button, then clip the stem from its back. Replace. You\\'ll be happy to have a less functional phone) If the young revolutionaries in Cairo had all had Rugbys last year, Mubarak could never have been toppled'),\n",

Thus, there is a PTT key on the left-hand side of the phone that is extremely sensitive and almost unavoidable when you open or otherwise handle the phone. As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

The button will no longer depress and activate the annoying PTT message, and if need be, I can simply reverse it by peeling the silicone out of the button recess.

I was told that it could take \"punishment\" up to a 30 foot fall. It makes me wonder a bit about the military specifications mentioned in the paperwork and various sites I\\'ve seen.

My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw. I'm looking forward to Apple finally getting the iPhone somewhere else so AT&T's subscriber pen get's busted open and they finally have to stop shaking down customers for accidental service in order to retain them. It's gotten unacceptable. + Two stars for what I feel is good Samsung quality (should have been 4). - Eleventy stars for AT&T customer disdain.\"),\n",

       "  'Samsung Rugby II will not connect to any PC Somebody has to tell the Samsung people that this phone has serious problem connecting to PC\\'s. I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn\\'t help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that\\'s it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the \\'mass storage\\' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn\\'t work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung \"New PC Studio\" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung \"New PC Studio\" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not \\'sync\\' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today\\'s world, an \\'advanced\\' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not \\'sync\\' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable. There are also no updates or upgrades to the phone software available yet. I have also called AT&T and they don\\'t know anything at all about this problem or care at all about it. They believe is a Samsung problem and not their problem to resolve. It is a total shame, because apart from this serious problem, that is still unresolved by Samsung, the phone is an average phone that works.'),\n",

It didn't seem random...rather, it seemed to happen when the phone rang and I attempted to pick it up. Other times it would just shut off in my pocket. I became obsessed with checking the phone to ensure it was still on since I used the phone for my job, and like most working folks, my phone calls are super important. Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now. I started using my old Samsung Propel - which suffered severe water damage and worked nonetheless, btw - and am infinitely more pleased. I just purchased a new model propel on Amazon and am looking forward to delivery.\"),\n",

It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.\"),\n",

       "  \"All Physical After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.\"),\n",

       "  '28 days later and . . . . . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating \"push to talk\" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too. I guess many of you love your Rugby phones, and I am glad you had better experiences with yours than I did with either of the two I tried.'),\n",

       "  '\"Not Blue Tooth Capable\" This is really a good, sturdy, basic flip phone. Sound quality is great, it\\'s easy to use, and the camera takes ok pics. I love the large display, no need for a magnifying glass to see the time/date or who\\'s calling! The reason for only a three star rating? I feel that Samsung comes way too close to false advertising stating that this phone is \"blue tooth capable\". Sure you can use a blue tooth with it, they just don\\'t mention anywhere (phone info. at store or owner\\'s manual) that only two brands on the planet will work with it (Jawbone and Bose) and these start at $130! That\\'s more then I paid for the phone! So I bought a basic (and cheap) Samsung phone and if I want a blue tooth I will need to fork over $130-$200? Um, no! Because I\\'m stuck with this Samsung until my phone is up for renewal, I\\'m now back to a headset (which again only a few will work with this phone). I guess I should be thankful the headset is only $20. Samsung, you let me down!'),\n",

       "  'Gusto-Good, Verizon-Bad I purchased this phone as an emergency backup for my sister after re-wiring her primary phone that was providing inconsistent service. The reception was extremely good, especially considering that she lives in rural West Virginia. The phone has a very user friendly menu system with readable fonts on a color display. Unfortunately, so far I have only been able to test the phone while talking with Verizon \"marketeers\". After opening the Gusto I was greeted by a very convenient message to activate the phone. I clicked the activate option and was put on hold for a very reasonable period of time while being entertained by Spanish guitar music. The marketing rep answered. To my amazement the rep informed me that I had won a $500 gift and that all I needed to do was pay $14.95 to have it shipped to my door. I reported that I was not interested in the gift but the marketer was persistent. I finally hung up without activation. The next day I tried again and dialed *611. The support person gave me a toll free number where I could pursue activation. I dialed the number and once again was greeted by a marketer who explained that I had won $500. After asking how his company could survive by giving away so many $500 gifts for $20 phone purchases the marketer told me I could bypass his office and attain activation by dialing the number again an pressing \"option 3\". After I hung up I was unable to locate \"option 3\", so here I sit with a phone hosted by a company that obviously makes it immmensely difficult to activate without accepting a $500 gift. If you buy this phone from Verizon be advised that you will need to negotiate an aggressive marketing gauntlet if you don\\'t want to take the offer.'),\n",

       "  'What a Dissapointment My old Motorola 120e bar phone was wearing out (literally) after 8 years...I couldn\\'t even see the numbers on the buttons any more. Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera \"feature\" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn\\'t work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won\\'t work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn\\'t even know this, and Samsung doesn\\'t point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone\\'s screen. That\\'s it. So, don\\'t waste your money expecting this to be anything more than a telephone. It works just fine as a telephone-but that\\'s it.'),\n",

The packaging was professional / good quality. The phone arrived ahead of schedule. Highly recommend seller. Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I\\'m over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won\\'t push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it\\'s Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I\\'m hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven\\'t really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven\\'t landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you\\'re going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can\\'t say much other than it appears to work well. I really don\\'t browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us \"throw back\" flip phone users who aren\\'t ready for a smart phone yet. This phone has more capability than I will ever use. I have only scratched the surface of the software options.'),\n",

This is the same model phone that Consumer Reports rated a best buy at the time I bought it the first time 10 years ago or more. Customer reviews of subsequent models have said that this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a rugged phone with great voice quality and a lit keypad with keys big enough for my big hands. By rugged I mean that I dropped my first one on the floor a number of times over the years without breaking it. I got Verizon on the phone and made sure my contacts were backed up and then activated the phone. Easy! As for TargetWireless, I started by asking them a question. I had an answer back within two hours. I ordered the phone. They shipped it the same day. It arrived earlier than promised, looking new in a small white box with places for the phone and charger, both in little plastic bags. It even has clear thin protective covers on the displays! It seems every bit as good as the one I bought new years ago. Thank you!\\xa0Samsung Convoy SCH-U640 Cell Phone Ruggedized PTT 2+ megapixel Camera for Verizon'),\n",

       "  'So far, really good! Amazing bargain at $10 This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.) Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device). My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that. My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I\\'ve ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that. So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it\\'s very hard to see what\\'s on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it\\'s a bit of a drag. Not the phone\\'s fault. Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it\\'s sitting on your desk, it doesn\\'t lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you\\'re in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or \"ok\" button, which seems the more common configuration. Haven\\'t had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.'),\n",

       "  'Samsung r355c n10 phone: One of the best $9.99 deals ever. I\\'ve been using the Samsung r355c n10 phone for a little over 2 weeks and so far so great. Granted, it\\'s not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you\\'re looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.). However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I\\'m happy with this phone so far and I\\'m also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-D Here is what I\\'ve experienced & observed so far: BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I\\'m happy with the battery. I just hope it\\'ll stay this strong for a while. CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet. CAMERA: Pictures aren\\'t the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there\\'s no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I\\'m a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics. INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you\\'re looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it\\'s 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download. KEYPAD: 1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I\\'d have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I\\'ve had no trouble typing. It\\'s pretty easy. 2). When not using the phone, it\\'s best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it\\'s easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on. 3). Fyi the red \"End pwr\" key is the \"home\" key. I didn\\'t know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the \"back\" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh! SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops\\' speakers that\\'s for sure. TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there\\'s a character count which lets you know when you\\'re about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it\\'s a minor issue considering the price of this phone. TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it\\'s still good. VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-( I know I\\'m leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.'),\n",

The browser is slow, but you can get your email and Facebook in due time, so it's good in a pinch. Call quality is as good as the Verizon system this phone uses, so if Verizon is good in your area, this phone is as good as it gets for call quality. Test messaging is as good as any smart phone.

Beforehand, I owned the Motorola flip phone, under Net10. Paid $30 for that, it was great as a starter for my first cell phone, paid for by myself. When my mom was paying my bill, I had the LG900G and it was great, loved the feel, the keyboard, all the little gadgets; absolutely awesome. I decided to shop around for an upgrade, something a little more my speed than a flip phone. After seeing this phone, I read all the reviews because I wanted to make sure I was getting the bang for my buck, even if it was only $10 ($16 & change because of shipping) and I decided that between this and the Net10 with the slide up keyboard, that this phone was the better deal. I've had it for two days now, transferring my number took five minutes online and then another 10-15 minutes with the phone physically. Quick, easy, and done in less than a half hour. I love the feel of the keys (I have tiny hands, so it works well with me) and it can do a lot for the price. Bought a case too, which should arrive to my house today, which I also paid $10 ($5 for the case, $4.95 shipping.) In total, I bought a brand new phone and a brand new case for $26.91, under the price I paid for the flip phone without a case ($30) and I'm very satisfied so far.

This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one. At only $9.99 who wouldn't?\"),\n",

       "  'Excellent Bargain, Terrible Service Rightfully, I should probably give this product one star rather than three, but I’m considering the possibility that I just got a defective cell. I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it’s never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What’s more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10’s website the phone still didn’t work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn’t receive a signal… almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn’t even work at our home whereas we’ve had AT&T and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we’d had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn’t resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they’d send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would’ve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.'),\n",

My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong. The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc. All in all, this is not a good phone.\"),\n",

This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book.

The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min. It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job. The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok. Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time.

I researched other Net10 CDMA phones, as I prefer the Verizon network. I also have Net10 LG900g, which is GSM, on ATT. (That is also a good phone, by the way...but Verizon is better in our area). I ordered another one of the R355C, not only because of the price. The phone clarity was great, texting was easy for me, alarm clock worked fine, all the things I really needed it for. It has a good speakerphone. The camera is not that great, because there is no zoom, etc. No extra features. You can't even enlarge it at all when someone sends a pic message. Sometimes you have to ask them what it is a photo of. That is the state of this camera. (the LG900g has a nice camera). The browser, well, it's a browser. Not a smartphone. You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want. It is slow, though, and not a computer experience. But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to. As a phone, as a texter, as an alarm clock, as a calculator, etc., it is wonderful. I was really sad to lose my first one and really happy to find another one here at this price. *** UPDATE **** The first one I received now was DOA. Not sure if battery or phone itself. Ordered a replacement for it, and now this one is shutting itself off after a few minutes. I need to return both. Should I try this model again? I don't know... I loved the one I lost...that is why I ordered another.

       "  \"over all good phone but has some annoyances Ive owned this phone a little over a month now and for the most part do not regret buying it at current price, $9. However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do. I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones. The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music. Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo. Speaker is on par with other cheap phones. I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger.\"),\n",

       "  \"At last, good reception at a reasonable price! I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing. My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us. I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway. A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account. As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these. The menus are well organized, and I use the phone as my daily alarm as well. I like the ringtones selection.\"),\n",

After recently becoming one of America\\'s newest smartphone customers, I was going to pass my pristine\\xa0Samsung A797 Flight Red At&t Qwerty Keyboard Touch Screen 3g Gps Cell Phone\\xa0to my youngest daughter until I saw this phone listed on Amazon.com. First off, the deal is crazy. Less than 25 dollars for this phone! Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter\\'s plan to her actual cell phone usage! Add a cute \"blinged-out\" phone case\\xa0Samsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight Talk\\xa0and a phone charm, and she is in business! Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box? It doesn\\'t support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn\\'t going to need that yet, but it\\'s nice to have, LOL). The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3\\'s for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won\\'t allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we\\'ve had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we\\'re probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls). Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone. Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price! **UPDATE** Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.'),\n",

This phone is small and actually takes half decent pix, though I would never use it for trying to do anything with them other that looking at them on the phone itself. I mainly use them for backgrounds on the phone. Call quality is great. I love the querty keyboard. I would never have a touch screen only keyboard. -That's just me. Bluetooth works great with my Mazda, I never have to touch the phone to make/receive calls. Tip, you have to keep it locked, which you can do manually by holding the space key or set autolock.

This phone had great battery life and very good reception. It is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. The MP3 player is nice, but I haven't found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. It isn't a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. The browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. The camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. If you live in a CDMA area with limited GSM service like I do, and you want to go the Net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! There is a newer version of this phone available for Straight Talk (R375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but I haven't seen it available for Net10. For now, this phone is just fine.\"),\n",

It fits nicely into the palm of my hand and the keypad is exactly what I wanted. HOWEVER, buyers beware. Make sure when you get a phone that it will work with the towers in your area. This one is set up for a place that has Sprint towers. Being 60 miles from Sacramento and 60 miles from Stockton, the major cell phone tower ill pjhones AT&T. I was going to return it BUT it's almost $7.00 to do a UPS drop-off and $13.00 for UPS to pick it up. I only paid $14.00 so it's not worth sending it back. Therefore I'll either keep it, gift it to someone who lives where the Sprint tower is or donate to a woman's center in the big city.\"),\n",

I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special. It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature. Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down.

So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion. The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone. I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy. I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS. Has a way to go. I was able to put it on my home WiFi and link the Bluetooth to my car handsfree system with no trouble at all. For the price, this is a great, functional phone. It isn't the be-all-end-all of phones, but for someone like me who is not a heavy cell phone user, it is delightful. I am very happy with it and I may either use my old Nokia as a backup emergency phone or donate it to those organizations who give phones to soldiers for calling home.\"),\n",

It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked. That if I connect the phone with at&t I would be able to send photos via msn. For the same reason I cannot use the phone's integrated gps. In other words 5 functions that comes with the phone you cannot use them unless you connected with at&t.

       "  \"Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5 I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.\"),\n",

       "  \"Good Start If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun. The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now. There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems. I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need. Samsung has a user manual available on their website with many tips and information not available anywhere else. Windowsphonehacker.com has the seveneighter file that I mentioned to update your phone with great help articles as well.\"),\n",

       "  \"A great travel and backup phone I have owned a Samsung Focus for two and a half years now. It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged. My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon. Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is. The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling. Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples). At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.\"),\n",

Not everything is perfect battery life is only for one day, you have to charge it everyday. You don't have skype and sugarsync apps but they said they are coming soon. The bad part of Windows Phone 7.5 is that you need to integrate the memory card to the file system. Its not hot swap and also you cant transfer files with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process. The The only way to transfer files to the phone is by mail or skydrive. With the Focus you don't get the Hotspot feature. For the user that is in Venezuela you can use the marketplace, i am in El Salvador. You have to configure the phone in the regional settings for USA and also your Hotmail or live account for USA.

As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work. The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work. When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over. The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant. As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7. When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device. When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on. (I eventually discovered that there\\'s a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.) As for that free music trial, I clicked the \"Cancel this subscription\" on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer. No sweat right? Wrong. This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen. After entering your password, MS says it still needs to \"verify\" who you are by sending a code to your email address. After retrieving and entering that, you select \"Account\", only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found. The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn\\'t correspond to the screens you actually see. At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you\\'re not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system. On another screen, you\\'re instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you\\'re instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes. But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn\\'t work and you should try again later.

The BIGGEST problem comes when you are not from US (like me) and, in order to be able to purchase apps, need to migrate to a non-US Market...the apps here (worldwide Market) are terrible or non-existent at most, the games are far from decent and Bing maps barely identifies mayor streets on capital cities. These issues needs to addressed by Microsoft ASAP, there is no way they could try to compete with Apple or Google seriously with so much restrictions on app publishing on other Markets. Pros: Cheap Fast Great Screen Mango Update makes the OS shine Lightweight Cons: Marketplace Battery Life\"),\n",

       "[\"Def not best, but not worst I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?\",\n",
       " 'Text Messaging Doesn\\'t Work Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone\\'s text messaging capabilities don\\'t work with Sprint\\'s system and won\\'t until a software patch comes out \"some time in the next few months\". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint\\'s award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed \"offline\" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest.',\n",
       " \"Love This Phone This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...\",\n",

Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)\",\n",

Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half.

I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget.

       " \"works great, but don't dropt it I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.\",\n",
       " \"Slow, annoying, fragile, heavy, and bulky... 1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.\",\n",
       " \"Worth paying more for something else. I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.\",\n",
       " 'Great free phone for Sprint customers. This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.',\n",

       " 'WARNING My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I\\'ve had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn\\'t even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don\\'t have service, you don\\'t get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end.

My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn\\'t expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years.

It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works.

As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on.

I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something.

I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.\",\n",
       " \"two for one! I needed a temporary phone for a friend in a retirement home until he got settled in his new place. I charged it up and it ran for several days on its own. He would have preferred a larger key pad due to his poor eyesight, but he seemed to do okay with it, and it was simple enough for him to be able to use it to simply make or receive calls (I didn't get into the answering system with him!). Now that he has moved and has his landline installed, I am giving it to a friend who has no cell phone, and cannot afford the price of a regular one. This will be just right for her limited calls when she is on the road. So.... two for the price of one!!\",\n",

       " 'STEEL. NOKIA STEEL. Over the past decade I have been through half a dozen cell phones. With a brief (and unsatisfactory) PANASONIC interlude, I have always gone NOKIA and did not regret it. My previous phone was NOKIA 6230i, a stylish working horse that, after three years of non-stop use, lately kept having ringer failure. I loved my phone and, although realized its time was up, did not want to have to familiarize myself with a whole different Menu SetUp. The NOKIA 6500-SLIDER was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful and robust brushed-steel finish, a large screen of impressive quality and one of the best phone cameras available (a 3.2Mpixels sensor behind an autofocus Carl Zeiss lens with flash). An important detail: the brushed steel is NOT that sensitive to fingerprint marks and will not require the constant wiping that other metal models do. The menu is intuitive and easy to use even if new to NOKIA 6-series. The buttons are large enough for adult fingers and, important for a slider phone, even the top buttons are fully accessible. Like most NOKIAs, the phone is greatly customizable, from colors and sounds to wallpapers and screensavers. It is robustly built and the slider glides easily in place with zero wobbling. NOKIA 6500-SLIDER is a beautiful phone that can be your helper for years. My only complaints are actually...three: (1) the very limited OnBoard memory (it has only 20MB - when my older 6230i had almost double that). Since only mp3s and photos stored on the Phone memory are guarantied to work when used as ring-tones or contact/group images, to have a cavernous 256MB Memory Card yet a puny 20MB OnBoard capacity seems ironic. (2) the placement of the speakerphone in the...back of the phone. Activate it and the phone speaks to your desk, voices coming out all muffled; and (3) the absence of photo stabilization. It may seem excessive for a phone, however when increasing the pixel number beyond 3M, image stabilization is actually essential if photos of any value are to be taken. All in all, an excellent stylish phone that, (six months after its initial release) should be available at bargain prices.',\n",

It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar. I often keep it in my pants pocket (the front pocket).\",\n",

The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other \"basic\" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone\\'s features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above. If someone is looking for a barebones phone this is more than fulfills the requirements.',\n",
       " \"Terrible Customer Service I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company.\",\n",

No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US.

If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for \"authorized personal only\", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I\\'ll be getting a new phone in a few months so I\\'ll live with this phone for now.

There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a \"+\" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example \"+15551212121\" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

       " 'Best one yet - except for browser My wife and I each have one of this model Tracfone. Neither has been a problem with outgoing or incoming calls. No dropped calls. Voice quality has been clear and natural sounding. We haven\\'t yet found any areas where the phone won\\'t work, and this covers New England to Oregon. Those are the \"pros.\" The following are the \"cons,\" along with some physical features we would like to see improved: - One of my biggest cons is the fact that the browser key is fixed and cannot be changed or disabled. The prompt that gets you into this limited browser can be easily activated and cost you fractions of minutes. - I carry my T301G sideways in a belt holder. I have occasionally missed a call when extracting the phone and quickly pressing the \"off\" button by mistake. This won\\'t shut the phone off, but it will cancel the incoming call. - The little, raised line under the display is used to slide the phone open. This line is too small and and just about useless to use. A rubber, or ribbed area on the side of the phone would be much more useful to slide the phone up. I find the process to be a \"two thumbs\" operation if you don\\'t want to press on the LED display all the time - or activate one of the soft keys which are much too close. - My previous Tracfone was a \"clamshell\" V176. This has a rubber feel to the phone, and I never thought I might drop the thing because of a slick, or slippery exterior. I wish the T301G was made from the same material - although I have not yet dropped this phone. - The four soft keys can be programmed for whatever you want. I have found that assigning your \"contact list,\" messages, list of incoming calls and phone info (minutes and time left) works best for me. The keys themselves, however, are still too small. The \"incoming calls\" one is needed for when I mistakenly disconnect a call as mentioned above. - I found the phone information that constantly scrolls across the screen to be distracting and irritating. I was able to shut this function off through the menu though. The press of one of the soft keys now tells me this information. The above \"cons\" are not a deal breaker for me. Life with this phone would be just a little easier if they were addressed. Some other thoughts: - I have never had trouble adding minutes to either phone. I do it over the internet. All they want is your phone number (as long as the phone is registered with Tracfone - easy to do). You purchase the minutes/time and they appear on the phone almost immediately. Keep the phone \"on\" while doing this. - My V176 lasted almost six years with no problems until the last two weeks of it\\'s life. If I can get this same performance from the T301G, then (for the price)I think it will be worth it. - I know it would make the phone a bit larger, but I wish the soft keys, menu and browser keys, and key pad itself were a little larger. Less room for error and more comfortable to use. - I have the phone set to answer (or call) when the slide is used. I don\\'t think the browser will activate, by accident, when the phone is closed, because it\\'s locked then. (Edit on the above - If the phone is \"on,\" then the browser will activate even when the phone closed (locked). This \"con\" continues to grow larger) Not a great camera, but it will do in a pinch. The volume control is on the side of the phone. Ascending from 1 thru 7. One press below 1 puts the phone on vibrate. Easy. All-in-all, this is a nice little phone, for the price, and the fact that no contracts are involved. Much less expensive to operate than than most any other phone. It would, (at least for me) be the perfect little phone if the above \"cons\" could be ironed out. __________________________________ March, 2014 -I have to add these thoughts to the above review. It\\'s been just about four years since I wrote the above comments. The necessity of opening the phone by placing a thumb on the screen has not been a problem at all. The rugged little screen is no worse for the constant manipulation. My wife and I were up in mid-Maine last May. I had my new Apple iPhone with me. Three of the others I was with had iPhones and one android phone. It was necessary to call a person at the local historical society. These four \"high end\" phones got \"no service\" in this remote area. I remembered that I had the Tracfone in the glove compartment, because I still had a couple of months of time left on the phone. Yes - you guessed it - the Samsung T301G made this call just fine. No, the T301G doesn\\'t take really clear photos and it\\'s difficult to send a text or record appointments. But, it was the only device (out of five) that actually made a telephone call! You know I put another year on the T301G and have it with me when I need to travel to these out-of-the-way places. I can now add \"dependable\" to the list of positive comments above. I don\\'t know why the Tracfone was the only one able to make the important call - I just know that it did. The above \"cons\" are still valid, but have not been the problem I anticipated when writing the initial post. This phone is a gem.',\n",
       " \"Browser button will eat away your minutes Just had to add my two cents. I read the reviews about the ease of accidentally hitting the browser button and losing minutes, and I ordered this phone anyway. And I agree 100% about the browser. While setting up the phone I have lost a few minutes already by accidentally hitting the darn browser key. What a dumb place to put a browser key! (It's the top right button on the front of the phone, and if you bump it, hit it, press it accidentally (even when the phone is in the closed position), if your phone is on, you will lose 0.5 minutes. I have searched all over the web and there is no way to disable it, or at least have it ask you if you want to connect. Terrible terrible feature. I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and entered *#4777*8665# and followed the instructions, and it doesn't work for me, and from other sites I have found out, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am going to see over the next month how much time I lose, and then I may have to take another reviewer's advice from another website and glue the button shut. (He said this worked for him fine and you can still get to the browser from the menu button). I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who has kids, your kids will drain their minutes by accident.\",\n",
       " \"This is a great phone! I purchased mine at a K-mart about a year ago. I fell in love with it and added some games to it by using credits (minutes) I had accumulated. The features are great and even though the internet access was a bit shaky and slow, that didn't matter to me since I didn't use it much for that purpose anyway. The coolest thing about this phone is I was helping my brother pull his boat up next to a dock and the phone slipped out of my pocket and into the water. Even though I only paid twenty bucks for it, new, I also had some 300 minutes on it and also some pictures I took, so I was dissapointed I would lose them both. I just looked at the phone sitting there on the sand, and even though I knew there wasn't much chance for it, I stretched my hand down as far as I could and retrieved the phone. The window lit up when I shook the water from it. My brother said I would have to take it apart right away and dry everything as quickly as possible. I wasn't sure how to take it apart, and didn't have any tools, but it was still working, so I figured it might be okay. Later the screen wouldn't come on, and I thought it was done. An hour or two later, the screen began to work again, but the key pad wouldn't work. A couple of hours later, the keypad began working again, and everything was fine. It has been fine ever since and that was over a week ago. The only thing I don't like is that the only way to retreive the pictures is to send them via e-mail to the computer. It does offer double minutes, so I figure it is still worth it. Now I get a kick out of using it knowing it laid on the sand under two feet of water and still works great.\",\n",
       " \"WORST PHONE EVER, Short Battery Life, No Bluetooth, ETC UPDATE: December 8, 2011 In the past year, I have gone through 3 of these phones. Based on that, the Samsung T301G has got to be one of the worst phones ever made. The main problem is that when the phone breaks, Tracfone sends out a REFURBISHED one. The refurbs were probably returned for the same reason as I returned my first phone (it was freezing and finally became unresponsive). After I called to ask that they send me a new phone, they said OK but they again sent a used one. I'm only going to activate it because most of their other phones have also gotten bad reviews. I picked this Tracfone after my Motorola broke after 2 years of use. This phone has very, very short batter life (needs to be charged every other day even if it hasn't been used very much) and it's Bluetooth function does NOT work with my Bluetooth enabled GPS and other devices for hands-free calling. The only positive is that the phone looks better than the Motorola and that it's faster at sending/receiving text messages, even though the controls and buttons to type the text are very small and hard to get used to. To sum it all up, if you can, please buy a different phone and save yourself the headache of having a broken phone every 3 months (and that's in the case of a NEW one. Used/Refurbished ones are broken OUT OF THE BOX). Tracfone used to be good, but with this, one of the worst phones ever made, and the fact that they keep sending me a used one makes them one of the most annoying companies I've had to deal with.\",\n",
       " \"I am still using this phone I spent time today looking for a new phone. All I see is heartbleed issues and battery eaters. I have used this phone since they came out with it. I never have battery problems. I have played Sudoku till my eyes hurt. It takes pretty nice pictures. It has a voice recorder that I even forget to use. The alarm clock is great. The bluetooth never worked. I dropped it once in Walmart and the headphone and USB cable never worked after that. But it does make calls and receive calls like it should. I used the browser occasionally. I don't think the browser works anymore. I can still email photos to my email. I think it is time for a new phone. The amazing thing is I found it in my purse lining. I traveled this week and couldn't find my phone. I thought it was lost forever. It kept sending out a low battery signal and I could hear where it was. I had a hole in my purse lining and the phone had slipped into the lining. The battery life is still amazing. Not sure what to do with a phone that really is a phone.\",\n",
       " \"T301G cant disable browser tied to back button cost you $ This phone is darn good EXCEPT, the browser is tied to the back button. So if you press the back button too many times, $.50 gets deducted when the browser is activated. No warnings of money to be taken. Unbelievable design flaw. Or maybe a scam by design. Otherwise, for the $30 I paid, its very good. I'm returning it now. No more samsung for me. FOLLOW-UP 1/25/2011: Apparently this flaw which prevents me from NOT getting this phone is NOT samsungs fault. I ordered a different replacement phone from TracFone/Net10 (same co.) and it does the same thing. They are programming these phones to do this. The manual says the key is attached to the contact list where the TracFone/Net10 version is attached to the Web and not re-programmable. So its not the phone. Sorry about that. It is a good phone otherwise but not with the Tracfone/Net10 folks. I left it at one star so folks can read the caveat if they use it with Tracfone/Net10.\",\n",
       " \"Lousy Signal/Short battery life I have another Tracfone (a simple Motorola flip) that I love. If it were still available I would have purchased it. I'm not a heavy cell phone user so prepaids are great for me. Why a got a second phone is a long, boring story. The bottom line is when this Samsung is immediately next to my Motorola in my home, it has sometimes has only 2 bars while my Motorola has four. I've had it in areas where there is generally excellent cell coverage where it has no reception/signal at all while my Motorola (again, immediately next to the Samsung) has four bars and is working fine. I have gotten nowhere near the standby battery life that is cited on Tracfone's product description. Most of my conversations are in the 1-3 minute range. Most days I make fewer than three calls. I can't imagine how short the battery life would be if I actually used it to talk for any period of time. Even fully charged at the beginning of the day the battery shows as low by the end of the day or the next AM. While there are some nice features (being able to assign ring tones to contacts) that my older phone doesn't have, those features are worthless if I can't make calls or the battery is dead or dying.\",\n",
       " 'Can\\'t See Who\\'s Texting You This phone is OK. The one thing that is really bad about this phone though is that if someone texts you, something will pop up on the screen that says \"1 new message\" and the time and date that the message was sent, that\\'s good but it doesn\\'t say who the message is from until you view the message. So sometimes it doesn\\'t matter if it shows you who it\\'s from or not, but a lot of times it does because after you open the message, minutes get deducted, so you could open a text from someone you don\\'t know or open a text that you don\\'t want to respond to, and you won\\'t know who it\\'s from until after your minutes get deducted. I have wasted a lot of minutes because of that. Although, when someone calls you it DOES say who the call is from. I am planning on getting a new phone that shows who your text messages are from. -Jill, Age 12',\n",
       " 'Sorry I Bought It Others have mentioned the same problems I have with the Samsung T301G: must recharge at least every 3 days and browser key is too easy to hit accidentally. Photos grainy and that I know of, no way to download onto a computer. Yes, sometimes locks up randomly in spite of using the menu to leave it unlocked. (Can unlock by entering code 1234.) In addition, even with the loudest ring tone I can find, I can\\'t hear it ring unless I\\'m in a totally quiet room--though I have no difficulty hearing my Motorola 370. Most annoying perhaps, is the fact that once you reach the name & number you want on the contact menu, you still to scroll through more options to reach \"Call\", instead of being able to just press the green button to \"Send\". And why in the world is \"Call\" not option #1 instead of #4? It\\'s an unnecessary step. Sending a text could be simplified. Having said all of that, sound quality and volume levels are excellent when making calls. It also has an excellent system of options for being able to view and delete information for missed calls and messages. Tracfone itself? In 7 years with them, while it sometimes requires a wait (like most companies!), once you get through, they\\'re usually able to solve the problem pretty quickly.

       " 'Bluetooth works with Ford Sync, do not count on support Tracfone still has the best geographic coverage of the pay as you go cell phone options. I had tried a Common Cents option when I wanted to upgrade to a phone with Bluetooth capabilities to work with a newly acquired car and bought in to the Common Cents hype about lower per minute cost and the round down on partial minutes of airtime. What Common Cents does not emphasize in their advertising is that there is absolutely no roaming. If you are outside of the Sprint network coverage area the phone will not work. Just because you have a friend or acquaintance with a Sprint Contract phone that gets coverage in the areas that you travel does not ensure that a Common Cents phone will work in those areas. I subsequently upgraded my Tracfone to the Samsung t301g which did pair with my Ford Sync system and allows hand free calling. I was unable to get the contact list from the phone uploaded to the Sync system but Ford does have some free downloadable software that allows you to create a contact list on your computer and then transfer it to the vehicle via a USB data key. The phone documentation is minimal and the download available from TracFone adds very little information. The default ringtone is progressive, starts out soft and gets louder, and I doubt that anyone will hear the first two rings in a store, restaurant or car. There are several other ringtones built in and I found one that was satisfactory when the volume is adjusted upward. The call volume is also adjustable during a call and most people will probably need to set it near the maximum for use with the hands free calling options with Ford Sync. One peculiarity of the phone is that there is no provision for setting the date and time manually and the time picked up from the network is about two minutes slow. I initiated a support request via email and one week, four emails and about 2 hours spent on the phone with three \"customer support\" representatives I finally received an email confirming that there was no way to manually adjust the time, that they could do nothing about the incorrect (Compared to NIST)time, and stating that the \"issue had been addressed\", which in my opinion is not the same as the issue being resolved. While the \"Customer Support\" representative were courteous, they speak a dialect that is difficult to understand and one every call you spend at least five minutes repeating information that you provided in you initial support request and all of your previous calls and then long periods on hold as they \"check with a supervisor\" or search \"their system\" for additional information regarding your problem. In summary the phone is usable and does provide some functionality with Ford Sync systems at a reasonable price when you factor in that you get double minutes for the life of the phone. TracFone support is basically non-existent. If you are the type that reads manuals and are willing to do some internet research Tracfone provides \"as needed airtime\" at a reasonable cost. If you are the type that likes or needs some hand holding you should probably look elsewhere and if you have become dependent on a cell phone to provide the correct time you definitely need a different phone.',\n",

Here is what it took to get RA #...4 calls/over 2 days. 2 calls were dropped by Tracfone due to volume.

To understand what I'm saying first you must get the explanation on why I purchased this phone. My younger brother had a tracfone and he lost the battery. How he managed to do that? Well I have no idea. Anyway the reason this phone was purchased was so he could just switch his sim card into it and move on with his life and my mother had recently purchased a year's worth of service on his original phone. Unfortunately Tracfone will not allow you to switch sim cards into a new phone, even though these both use the exact same model card.

       " 'Worth the current price of $5 A few comments on this phone: 1) The builtin ringtones are lame, they\\'re uninspiring, almost random sounding \"tunes,\" however I find the ring volume loud enough, in contrast to complaints from some users that it\\'s too low. Perhaps Samsung fixed this issue. 2) The screen is 2\" diagonal, which is a good size for a low end phone, however the low resolution makes it a bit grainy. Also it has a narrow viewing angle, i.e. you have to hold it at a certain angle or it appears dark or washed out. 3) The mobile web capability is very limited because of the phone\\'s low memory. Originally Tracfone only allowed you to go to a set of preselected sites. Now you can enter any URL, but most of the time you get an insufficent memory error because the site is too large. I mainly use it to get info. by searching Google, in lieu of the Google SMS service that they discontinued. 4) As others have noted, when you close the slider the outer buttons don\\'t lock immediately, you have to wait a few seconds before putting it in your pocket, otherwise the browser button could get pushed and you can lose a lot of minutes. 5) Battery standby time is less than a week, which is lower than other phones I\\'ve used. On the other hand it recharges faster than usual. EDIT: I recently charged the phone on a Sunday night, and it lasted until the next Monday morning, with light usage during the week. It will stay at one battery bar for a while and still be functional. When you recharge it, there doesn\\'t seem to be any alert when it is finished, you have to just see if the battery icon is full. 6) The menu screens have a black and orange color scheme which, while readable, is a bit odd. I got it when it was $8, from Dealathon, and I\\'m still using it. Overall I\\'d say it is worth the current price of $5, for those of us who are not into the complexity and cost of smartphones. You can upgrade to another Tracfone later on. You can connect it to your Windows PC using a free program from Samsung and a cable you can get from Amazon for a few dollars, see this thread on the Howard forum: [...] ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unlike some of their other phones, Samsung doesn\\'t provide a PDF booklet/manual for this phone.

It will inform you that you need to restart the phone for this to take effect - do this later. Then go to menu number 2, GPRS detach. The phone will notify you that it has done the GPRS detach, which means that it is no longer connected to the GPRS network. Now restart the phone, and there should be a blue and white G at the top of the screen instead of a red and white one. Success! Of course, you may reverse this at any time by going back to the secret menu and selecting Auto attach and GPRS attach. This will NOT adversely affect your ability to add minutes to the phone via [...] or by using a minutes card purchased in a store.

Then 80 to 60, then 60 to 30 and I had not made a call. Didn't know why, still don't know why unless like the other reviewers said the browser was accidentally being turned on. Tracfone replaced it first saying the phone was defective, but the new one is doing the same thing. MINUTES DISAPPEAR. When I complained was told several times by the first two women that the phone was working properly and they did their best to dismiss me. So, I asked if they were calling me a liar. Finally they decided to send me a new, different brand of phone. What irks me about this entire situation is, you KNOW they KNEW what was happening to me, yet feigned ignorance. After I told them I had been a faithful tracfone user for eight years and did not have this problem with my other phone, did their attitude change a bit. Still very upset the way they treated me, but it is typical of the way companies treat their customers these days. AT&T is worse, much worse. If I had a choice I would change. In fact, I felt like just giving up all this technology and doing without a cell phone. How much do we have to pay to be treated like garbage? Tracfone you are the pits today. It's terrible to waste so much time talking to these people, even if in the end they do what is right. I know I was on the phone way over an hour.

       " 'The Best of TracFone in my opinion You can read on an unopened package what features a phone has but what people really need to hear is how those features you use most \"work.\" It\\'s a well built phone that I will use mostly for talking and limited texting. My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing). Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down! Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction. The 376 has a \"flimsy\" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily. The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear. Samsung produced some features you don\\'t see in the average \"prepay plan phones.\" The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors). They\\'ll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.',\n",
       " \"How to fix browser problem As some of you have discovered these phones, along with many others, have a habit of accidentally dialing the browser when you place the phone in your holster and eating up lots of minutes. The simple fix is to wait about five seconds for the screen to go blank before placing the phone in the holster. This locks the keys until you press unlock then OK or slide the phone open. The browser will not dial if you wait these few seconds. It's a pain and stupid on Samsung's part but it's the only way to prevent this problem, there's no way to lock out the browser.\",\n",

You may find yourself in a \"black hole\". The little Samsung works OK, the display is bright and the buttons not too responsive (except the cursed browser one). Volume control is not quite up to par. The menu to access functions is unncessarily complicated and not at all intuitive.',\n",
       " \"good basic phone but proprietary limited accessories Read other reviews for pros/cons, but do note that the dual use charger-headset jack is not micro or mini USB. According to Samsung and a local dealer, there is no adapter available. None of the multiple adapters provided with the phone will work w/the proprietary jack. So, you cannot use your own plug-in headset or a universal external extended battery, and there are no OEM extended batteries w/cover. I was told by a dealer that post 2008 phones must have compatible micro or mini jacks, and T301g is older. If this is not an issue for you, the phone is a very good simple phone, especially once the browser is disabled. These are problems for me, and may be for you: 1. microphone quality of provided headset is significantly lower than the Plantronics I was using; 2. I am in a rural area and the battery use is higher than the previous Motorola tracfone, so other battery options are helpful; 3. bluetooth costs more than the phone, and given phone and battery life, didn't seem a worthwhile investment.\",\n",

The problem was Verizon's not the seller. The 2nd Verizon rrep got the phone activated. The seller called me and asked me to remove my negative comment which I am attempting to do.

Bought a new charger (now we;\\'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It\\'s used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone\\'s failure to even operate in basic mode. I\\'ve got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be \"refurbished\" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you\\'re taking a big risk that it\\'ll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned.

We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I \"upgraded\" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn\\'t want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn\\'t like their current non-smart phones. I\\'m guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don\\'t use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon\\'s better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn\\'t upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from \"Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)\" to \"Legacy/unsupported phone. Don\\'t waste your time to try again\". If I didn\\'t see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn\\'t see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online \"upgrade/replacement\" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn\\'t think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn\\'t want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don\\'t have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon\\'s GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.',\n",

So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.\",\n",

The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It\\'s not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn\\'t the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I\\'m rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn\\'t for everyone; it has none of the smartphone \"flair\" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn\\'t lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.',\n",

We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had.

Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use \"genuine\" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn\\'t have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash.

Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I\\'m not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can\\'t do it anymore.. and the sellers don\\'t seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone\\'s Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn\\'t get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was \"completely functional\" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn\\'t find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what\\'s the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don\\'t even know that the equipment they are selling doesn\\'t work correctly (my seller didn\\'t even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn\\'t apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone\\'s extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they\\'re selling isn\\'t suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.

I had to pray over it to get it to last the additional year. I really did pray over it. The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

       " 'VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon\\'s support community forum site (search for \"Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..\"). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone\\'s Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not.

I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible.

       " 'Avoid like the plague - bad hardware, Keystone Cops service Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the \"wrong battery\", \"unsupported battery\", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn\\'t arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they\\'d mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and \"*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired.\" and in a separate email, \"Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST.\" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by \"We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST\". A week later, I got another message, \"Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing\", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA.

I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it. What I also love about this phone is that I text over 1000 texts a month. I only pay $20.00 a month for a text bundle. I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what. I love the Samsung Smooth with the Verizon service. Never lose a call or miss one, I can text all day long, every day for only $20.00 a month, and all of the extras that I described above.

As such, I expect she will use the phone for a few days every couple of months. The payment plans available are extremely unfriendly for this purpose. All of the available plans are \"use it or lose it\" - minimum deposit is $15 monthly or $25 that expires in 3 months. When the billing period is up, AT&T eats all your unspent funds and you have to pump more into the account in order to use the phone again. There is NO option for people who want to pay only for time used. I suppose I shouldn\\'t be surprised by this, but the ATT reps are apparently coached to be dishonest when setting up the plans as well. I asked the rep I spoke with at least 3 times if there were any hidden fees or monthly minimums, and she said \"no\" three times. After making an additional deposit I get on the web site and learn about the \"expiration date\" on money deposited. If you were planning to use this phone as a backup, plan to spend at least $100 a year in fees just to keep the phone accessible for emergency use.',\n",

Good to have a phone on me in case of emergencies or if I need to further irradiate my brain with microwaves. Have a Nokia 6030 \"candy bar\" phone I was happy with, EXCEPT the exposed keypad permitted a lot of \"butt dialing.\" So, I went to RadioShack (R.I.P.) and bought the cheapest GSM phone they had w/o a contract. The Samsung was $16 on sale and the RadioShack employee offered to swap out my SIM chip and transfer all my phone information onto the Samsung. The Samsung\\'s covered keypad eliminated \"butt dialing.\" Signal strength and clarity are worse on the Samsung. One day my battery ran down and I needed it to meet an appointment. Did not have a spare battery so I attempted to swap the SIM card back to the Nokia. SAMSUNG DESIGNED IT SO YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE SIM CARD. I got customer support at samsung.com/us/support/ . FAQ had illustrations on how to remove it. Didn\\'t work... (I sold technology for 30 years so I know how to troubleshoot and repair electronics.) A \"Tech Chat\" window popped up on samsung.com/us/support/ I gave her the problem, the same FAQ page appeared and POOF, the Customer NO SUPPORT person was gone... Relogged onto the site gave another customer rep the problem and told them NOT to show me the FAQ page again. I got told to take the phone to the phone center since the FAQ did not work.

       " \"Good phone in a pinch I have one of these. Initially bought back when my original AT&T Samsung Impression went kaput. I have now been on a smartphone kick, progressing from the MB860 Atrix 4G to the MB865 Atrix 2 (This was actually a downgrade from the 4G unfortunately, it sucked) and now onto the MB886 Atrix HD. Back onto the subject oof the A107: Call quality was good-to-excellent: Never dropped a call, others heard me loud and clear, hearing them was loud and clear as well. If I recall, this does have a speakerphone through use of the ear receiver. Features were poor/lacking: It was able to call and text, I'm not sure I remember ever being able to connect to the internet on it however. I know it's not an HSPA/EVDO device (3G) but I should have still been able to pull up a single page on Google or Yahoo, however that was not capable even on the 1X data connection. Reliability was excellent: The phone still works to this very day, it's never bugged out on me or not turned on or made a call when I wanted & needed it to. Ruggedness was excellent: I am notorious for dropping my phones. I have dropped this thing numerous times but it functions perfect, the only thing apparent is the scuffs and marks on the outside of the case. Battery life was excellent: I remember using this phone for days with plenty of talk and text going on and not having to charge it very often at all. When I did charge it, I'd charge it overnight (8~hours) and use it until it was about dead again. It would last for days though, I am positive on that. *Not sure about if you're seeing this at the $27 price I am now, but I can honestly say I'd hold off on it for that price. I got mine for $19 + tax in Wal-Mart years back.\",\n",
       " \"Maybe good kid phone for text msgs, but not much for voice I bought this phone as a step in porting my land line phone to Google Voice. (For some reason Google can only port cell phone numbers.) So first I port my home phone to this cell phone and then to Google. Details of this process are all over the web so I won't repeat them here. I didn't intend to really use it for calls which is a good thing because the phone is really cheap. This phone is almost unusable for voice calling. Don't get the idea that this is a good choice for anything but a backup to your backup phone used only if you were stranded on a desert island. I suppose it could be used by kids who mostly text since that part of the phone is pretty standard. Setup was simple following the instructions in the box. It did take at least 10 minutes to activate. it turns out to be only $0.10/min and $0.20/text. Probably heavy text users would go for one of the /day or /month plans. They seem to charge for everything but calling 611. For example, it looks like even if the phone is forwarded they charge for the call time.\",\n",
       " \"Cost only slightly more than just a SIM chip. These are $10 +$2 S&H at Walmart's online store, $3 more in-store. The only way I found to import my contacts was by copying them onto my SIM card from an old phone. No software available from Samsung, no iSync support - even from third parties, nothing from Google or Yahoo. (Please add a comment if you come across anything@) TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access. They'll warn you that this will also disable MMS (Picture/sound/video messaging) but since you can't send such messages anyway, this is probably not a big deal. **Now I don't have to worry about being charged every time I press the wrong button and it starts.** I use my Verizon MiFi with my MacBook Pro, iPod or iPad for mobile 'net access. Service: I recommend the $2/day plan. You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.) It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out. If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device. Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone. Cell Phone: The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy. It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system, No time-sucking learning curve. Final Word: I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months. Plus, you can buy $25 cards at a discount if you shop around. The phone serves my needs and I am very satisfied with it. But, smartphones are getting cheaper and cheaper...\",\n",
       " \"Simple sturdy spare replacement phone for clumsy people My phone on our family plan got stolen and I did not want to spend a lot of money on a temporary replacement phone. So I go this prepaid phone, went to ATT and they made me a new sim card for free and I popped it in this phone. Eventually my stolen phone was recovered so I just took the sim out and put it in the recovered phone. More recently I washed my good phone in the laundry, but the sim still worked so I just popped it back in this handy spare. It is a simple phone with no fancy features. There is no camera, but you can get online and check email. I've also dropped it several times and it hasn't broke yet, so I say it is worth it especially for a clumsy person or a kid or if you just need a spare.\",\n",

My wife and I each have our own cell phones and hers is used as our main phone number, we do not have a land line anymore.

       " 'A solution-painless replacement of a lost phone on a family plan My stepson lost his mother\\'s cellphone. The phone, which my wife did not like much anyway, was on my family plan. My wife prefers clamshell phones so my plan to pass her down my IPhone 3GS was not met with any enthusiasm. So how did I get her a new cellphone, one she likes, put it on the plan, and not extend my plan by another two years? This phone is the answer. First it\\'s a clamshell. Second it is priced right. Third, AT&T will put in a new SIM card for her family plan number. Finally none of this extends my existing plan should I want to switch providers (and I am not sure I do since AT&T is getting better). Now please note that by installing a new SIM card, this becomes a regular cellphone on my plan. It is no longer a prepaid phone. The voice quality is quite good. It has a camera, which my wife is unlikely ever to use. It has what it calls \"Apps\" was are a few limited and unimaginative mini-programs. It can text, another feature my wife won\\'t use, and has a means to download a few MP3s. An iPhone it\\'s not. My wife can use it, and we can communicate, and that\\'s all that really counts.',\n",

I'm a student so I always keep my phone on vibrate (in fear that my phone will go off during lecture). This is annoying: when I'm walking, I cannot feel this phone vibrate in a my pocket. 3.

       " \"Cheap phone I bought two of these phones for my wife and I directly from the AT&T store because we moved in an area that AT&T had a monopoly and our Verizon phones wouldn't get signal. (Feels like this shouldn't even be legal in this day and age but that's another story.) These phones are very confusing to navigate and even the graphics feel like they are about five years behind the times. But I didn't expect much for what I paid so I can't complain too much about that. Unfortunately after less than three months my wife's phone completely stopped working. It made noise like someone was calling when they weren't, it couldn't complete calls, and the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than about twelve hours without even using it. Because it was more than 30 days I would have to do a warranty replacement rather than exchange it. I decided that it wasn't even worth my time to warranty replace it since I didn't like the phone to begin with. Unless price is your only concern in buying a phone (it was my main concern when I bought this) I recommend paying a bit more and getting a better phone. I'll be keeping my phone simply because I'm not to the type to waste money when mine still works but I won't be disappointed when it breaks and I have to buy a better phone.\",\n",

You lose a star for having two unconfigurable face-buttons which default to online services. You lose a star for having extensive battery problems not 6 months into my owning of this phone. It's true. Merely shutting the clam-shell apparently jars the battery contacts out of place 3 times out of 4.

Usually, I spend about $25 on it every month, but if there is a $15 card, I can get away with spending that much. A 100MB package should do it for the first month, and then with rollover, you can buy less expensive internet packages. It is almost impossible to use up 100MB on this phone, and I use my internet daily for hours on end. Sometimes my hands are shaky, and that makes typing on one of those mini-keypads on the more expensive phones nearly impossible for me. Not only that, this phone fits in my hands well. That is, when I use other phones for hours on end, my thumbs hurt. However, with this phone, there is no pain. Once you get used to its typing features, typing a message on it is a snap! Thanks Samsung and AT&T! I have had this phone now for a few years and still love it!\",\n",
       " \"simplicity manifested through gophone I've just bought this phone over the past weekend at BB for $15 and bought $25 airtime. Service: So far, I have to say I am quite happy with it. I previously had T-Mobile prepaid but had to switch because I had no service in my house. After switching to AT&T, I can actually make calls/texts in my house. The service is quite cheap as well, I am on the Simple Rate plan. It costs $.10/min to talk which gets deducted from your prepaid balance. Standard texting costs $.25 per text, but I bought 200 messages for $4.99 that lasts for 30 days (Comes to $.02/text). Cell Phone: The phone was super cheap and yet it is quiet sturdy. There is no exterior screen, making it that much more stable/energy efficient. It is quite possibly the simplest phone you can buy new on the market. It does not have the capacitive touchscreen that you will find on an iPhone, it does not have an HD screen, nor does it let you scroll through the internet like you would on your computer. Instead, this phone lets you make calls and send/receive text messages. Crazy right? It is not made to be the shiny object that attracts the nearby fishes and sheep, it is simply a mobile phone for communicating. My only quip is that is has no volume control buttons on the side, not a huge issue, just something I would have liked. I also use the phone as my alarm to wake up. Final Word: I estimate that it will cost me about $10-15 a month for their service a month. I usually text a lot more than I make calls, but I spend no more than 100-150 minutes a month which equals $10-15. Now that I have the $4.99 texting package, I will probably reduce my minutes, making it go down to 50-10 minutes. The phone serves is purpose, I am very satisfied with it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a volume control button the side, it doesn't so I'll live without it but it is not perfect. It meets all my criteria of needs, nothing else to say.\",\n",

It's not exactly fair to pick on a $9.99 phone but since all I expected were basic functions and this one failed to deliver, I thought I had to comment. Most importantly, the phone I purchased started to shut off by itself after a few months causing me to miss incoming calls and texts. Then, even when it was on, texts sent to me in the morning would show up late in the day, as would voice mail messages and missed call indicators. I ended up replacing the phone and all of these problems disappeared so I can't seem to fault my network provider. Again, $9.99 is not a lot to pay for a phone, but making and receiving calls when I wish is not a lot to expect from a cellular device at any price. You'll save money with this phone but you'd be better off saving yourself a lot of aggravation by purchasing a different product.\",\n",

Anyway what I wanted was a tough phone with 3G. (At&T doesn't have 2G in some parts of the country which I found out on our last motorcycle trip with my old RAZZ). My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue. I carefully put a heavy bead of superglue around the PTT button. PTT hasn't activated in over a month, now I'm happy with the phone.\",\n",
       " \"step down from Motorola Tundra I got this phone a week ago because ATT didn't stock the Motorola Tundra. Tundra had been through 4 years of rough use including purposly throwing it on the floor when someone was bragging about their new smart phone. I wasn't impressed with the construction when I purchased it but had to have a replacement. The Rugby II was the toughest phone stocked at the store. The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections. IM is the only lockable internet ap in the Rugby II Tundra was able to usb connect to PC for data transfer. Rugby II has to have a mini sim card installed before it will even try.

I've had to terminate calls because I couldn't hear the ther party well enough to continue. I never had this problem with my old Motorola EM330. Texting is a chore with the poorly laid out format requiring you to change screens for simple punctuation or numeric functions. AT&T keeps trying to blame the reception issues on a local network problem. A coworker has an identical phone with the identical problem. Other coworkers with AT&T service, but different phones do not have this issue. As an MP3 player coupled with my Bluetooth it's great. As a phone, it leaves a lot to be desired.\",\n",

I had 3 of them that broke inside of a year (from the *original* date of purchase, mind you).

Well, I\\'m happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven\\'t had any dropped calls. I haven\\'t had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don\\'t seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it\\'s folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven\\'t found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they\\'ve been added. It\\'s bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I\\'m suddenly feeling lighter, I know I\\'ve left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn\\'t the phone you want. You\\'ll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven\\'t had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won\\'t SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they\\'re not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don\\'t know if there was a voice dial option, but it\\'s on the II. It\\'s just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don\\'t try to voice dial 911. You\\'ll die before the call\\'s been made (maybe I\\'m exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory\\'s decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more \"consumer-ized\" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. \"how does this damn thing work?\" \"Can\\'t you reboot it?\" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I\\'m getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I\\'ll review that soon, too.

When that phone broke, we decided to try the newer Rugby II. After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn\\'t know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a \"Rugged\" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung.

Samsung tech support first told me I had a bad data cable, then that I needed to re-load the software, then finally admitted it wasn't going to work. No more Samsungs for me.

The ever-reliable Nokia had served me faithfully for 7 full years when ATT determined that it couldn\\'t tolerate such superb service in its network. The planet\\'s largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a \"free\" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several \"free\" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, \"None,\" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a \"free\" phone, I\\'d need to buy the \"reliable\" model. 3. In \"upgrading\" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4. The PTT feature has been located such that it cannot be avoided--and which brings additional charges when used. (But this can be disabled. Pry out the button, then clip the stem from its back.

As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

Rather than glue it or clip the little nib that activates the PTT inside the button, what I did easy is and totally reversible: I pried the button out, smeared a little bit of RTV Silicone into the recess, replaced the button, wiped off the excess silicone and let it cure overnight. The button will no longer depress and activate the annoying PTT message, and if need be, I can simply reverse it by peeling the silicone out of the button recess.

As an owner of a landscape company, I need a phone in my pocket all the time. I often answer it with wet, muddy gloves without a problem. My phone takes a lot of abuse in my pocket. I'm always climbing trees, crawling in dirt, carrying boulders against my thigh and often working in the rain. I WANTED a smart phone, but I NEEDED a tough, trustworthy phone. This may not be a smart phone, but it is one of the most important tools my company has. A smart phone is worthless if it can't be in my pocket all the time.

The other day I got the phone out of my pocket and the display was messed up. Took it to an AT&T store who told me that it was a pressure crack which couldn't be repaired and wasn't covered by warranty. They acknowledged that there was no exterior damage but said that there was nothing they could do for me other than sell me a new phone. I don't subject electronics to harsh treatment, in fact the phone has been very gently handled and shows no exterior wear or tear. How can Samsung and AT&T advertise this as a rugged phone? I'm extremely disappointed that neither of them stand by this product or their customer service. BTW - The other reviewer comments about the placement of the PTT and browser buttons are so true. Accidental activation of these services are constantly inevitable with this phone.\",\n",

The phone was mailed to the wrong address, and then ATT customer service told me there was no way I had bought the phone through Amazon (they didn't call me a liar, mind you, they just implied it). I was basically treated like I was a criminal for two days before things were sorted out. I'm canceling my ATT service and going with anyone else.

My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw. I'm looking forward to Apple finally getting the iPhone somewhere else so AT&T's subscriber pen get's busted open and they finally have to stop shaking down customers for accidental service in order to retain them. It's gotten unacceptable. + Two stars for what I feel is good Samsung quality (should have been 4). - Eleventy stars for AT&T customer disdain.\",\n",

       " 'Samsung Rugby II will not connect to any PC Somebody has to tell the Samsung people that this phone has serious problem connecting to PC\\'s. I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn\\'t help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that\\'s it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the \\'mass storage\\' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn\\'t work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung \"New PC Studio\" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung \"New PC Studio\" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not \\'sync\\' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today\\'s world, an \\'advanced\\' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not \\'sync\\' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable. There are also no updates or upgrades to the phone software available yet. I have also called AT&T and they don\\'t know anything at all about this problem or care at all about it. They believe is a Samsung problem and not their problem to resolve. It is a total shame, because apart from this serious problem, that is still unresolved by Samsung, the phone is an average phone that works.',\n",

I fixed it by disassembly the phone to remove the button. I then put a thin piece of silicone tubing behind the button, making it much harder to inadvertently press, but still functional.

       " \"This must be the waterboy of the rugby team... So within a few months of owning the phone, it began to turn itself off CONSTANTLY. It didn't seem random...rather, it seemed to happen when the phone rang and I attempted to pick it up. Other times it would just shut off in my pocket. I became obsessed with checking the phone to ensure it was still on since I used the phone for my job, and like most working folks, my phone calls are super important. Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now. I started using my old Samsung Propel - which suffered severe water damage and worked nonetheless, btw - and am infinitely more pleased. I just purchased a new model propel on Amazon and am looking forward to delivery.\",\n",

It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.\",\n",
       " \"All Physical After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.\",\n",
       " '28 days later and . . . . . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating \"push to talk\" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too.

       " '\"Not Blue Tooth Capable\" This is really a good, sturdy, basic flip phone. Sound quality is great, it\\'s easy to use, and the camera takes ok pics. I love the large display, no need for a magnifying glass to see the time/date or who\\'s calling! The reason for only a three star rating? I feel that Samsung comes way too close to false advertising stating that this phone is \"blue tooth capable\". Sure you can use a blue tooth with it, they just don\\'t mention anywhere (phone info. at store or owner\\'s manual) that only two brands on the planet will work with it (Jawbone and Bose) and these start at $130! That\\'s more then I paid for the phone! So I bought a basic (and cheap) Samsung phone and if I want a blue tooth I will need to fork over $130-$200? Um, no! Because I\\'m stuck with this Samsung until my phone is up for renewal, I\\'m now back to a headset (which again only a few will work with this phone). I guess I should be thankful the headset is only $20. Samsung, you let me down!',\n",
       " 'Gusto-Good, Verizon-Bad I purchased this phone as an emergency backup for my sister after re-wiring her primary phone that was providing inconsistent service. The reception was extremely good, especially considering that she lives in rural West Virginia. The phone has a very user friendly menu system with readable fonts on a color display. Unfortunately, so far I have only been able to test the phone while talking with Verizon \"marketeers\". After opening the Gusto I was greeted by a very convenient message to activate the phone. I clicked the activate option and was put on hold for a very reasonable period of time while being entertained by Spanish guitar music. The marketing rep answered. To my amazement the rep informed me that I had won a $500 gift and that all I needed to do was pay $14.95 to have it shipped to my door. I reported that I was not interested in the gift but the marketer was persistent. I finally hung up without activation. The next day I tried again and dialed *611. The support person gave me a toll free number where I could pursue activation. I dialed the number and once again was greeted by a marketer who explained that I had won $500. After asking how his company could survive by giving away so many $500 gifts for $20 phone purchases the marketer told me I could bypass his office and attain activation by dialing the number again an pressing \"option 3\". After I hung up I was unable to locate \"option 3\", so here I sit with a phone hosted by a company that obviously makes it immmensely difficult to activate without accepting a $500 gift. If you buy this phone from Verizon be advised that you will need to negotiate an aggressive marketing gauntlet if you don\\'t want to take the offer.',\n",

Similarly I've had friends ask why I didn't text them back, when I never received it. On the phone itself, it's a basic no thrills package. You can't zoom in on pictures.

       " 'What a Dissapointment My old Motorola 120e bar phone was wearing out (literally) after 8 years...I couldn\\'t even see the numbers on the buttons any more. Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera \"feature\" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn\\'t work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won\\'t work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn\\'t even know this, and Samsung doesn\\'t point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone\\'s screen. That\\'s it.

Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I\\'m over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won\\'t push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it\\'s Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I\\'m hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven\\'t really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven\\'t landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you\\'re going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can\\'t say much other than it appears to work well. I really don\\'t browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us \"throw back\" flip phone users who aren\\'t ready for a smart phone yet.

Just the same, it's useless at the moment and I'm rather irritated at having paid as much when I could have gotten something better and more to the point, one that came with everything I needed to be able to use it. The seller was correct on everything else; it is exactly as advertised. Just make sure you get the damn charger.\",\n",

       " \"Great phone for the $$ After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.\",\n",
       " 'So far, really good! Amazing bargain at $10 This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.) Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device). My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that. My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I\\'ve ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that. So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it\\'s very hard to see what\\'s on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it\\'s a bit of a drag. Not the phone\\'s fault. Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it\\'s sitting on your desk, it doesn\\'t lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you\\'re in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or \"ok\" button, which seems the more common configuration. Haven\\'t had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.',\n",
       " 'Samsung r355c n10 phone: One of the best $9.99 deals ever. I\\'ve been using the Samsung r355c n10 phone for a little over 2 weeks and so far so great. Granted, it\\'s not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you\\'re looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.). However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I\\'m happy with this phone so far and I\\'m also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-D Here is what I\\'ve experienced & observed so far: BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I\\'m happy with the battery. I just hope it\\'ll stay this strong for a while. CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet. CAMERA: Pictures aren\\'t the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there\\'s no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I\\'m a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics. INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you\\'re looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it\\'s 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download. KEYPAD: 1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I\\'d have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I\\'ve had no trouble typing. It\\'s pretty easy. 2). When not using the phone, it\\'s best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it\\'s easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on. 3). Fyi the red \"End pwr\" key is the \"home\" key. I didn\\'t know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the \"back\" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh! SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops\\' speakers that\\'s for sure. TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there\\'s a character count which lets you know when you\\'re about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it\\'s a minor issue considering the price of this phone. TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it\\'s still good. VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-( I know I\\'m leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.',\n",
       " \"Good for the Purpose. It looks like a Blackberry, but isn't a smart phone. It does not have the ability to use apps except for those limited few that come with it, but at least it looks more modern than other basic phones. The browser is slow, but you can get your email and Facebook in due time, so it's good in a pinch. Call quality is as good as the Verizon system this phone uses, so if Verizon is good in your area, this phone is as good as it gets for call quality. Test messaging is as good as any smart phone. It has an Mp3 player with playlists, and it will connect to any Bluetooth device to play music in your car or through a Bluetooth speaker. There is no Wi-Fi. I like the real keyboard as opposed to the touch keyboards of other phones. I like the real buttons as opposed to the touch screen, so for me, this works well for my needs. It won't satisfy those users who need the latest and greatest high speed internet while on the go.\",\n",
       " \"For the price, the overall quality, and everything else, this was a steal! Definitely believe I hit the jackpot when I found this phone. Beforehand, I owned the Motorola flip phone, under Net10. Paid $30 for that, it was great as a starter for my first cell phone, paid for by myself. When my mom was paying my bill, I had the LG900G and it was great, loved the feel, the keyboard, all the little gadgets; absolutely awesome. I decided to shop around for an upgrade, something a little more my speed than a flip phone. After seeing this phone, I read all the reviews because I wanted to make sure I was getting the bang for my buck, even if it was only $10 ($16 & change because of shipping) and I decided that between this and the Net10 with the slide up keyboard, that this phone was the better deal. I've had it for two days now, transferring my number took five minutes online and then another 10-15 minutes with the phone physically. Quick, easy, and done in less than a half hour. I love the feel of the keys (I have tiny hands, so it works well with me) and it can do a lot for the price. Bought a case too, which should arrive to my house today, which I also paid $10 ($5 for the case, $4.95 shipping.) In total, I bought a brand new phone and a brand new case for $26.91, under the price I paid for the flip phone without a case ($30) and I'm very satisfied so far. I'll update if anything changes, but so far, it fits all of my needs.\",\n",
       " \"great phone I bought this phone so I could answer text messages from my kids, grandkids and brothers without taking 3 minutes to text 3 words. At first I was a little concerned about the small buttons but I got used to them very quickly. I get much better reception than my old phone. I don't have to stop in my tracks when I'm in the store and my wife calls me to add to our grocery list. It did take almost the full 72 hours for Net10 to transfer my old phone number and minutes, but it was well worth the wait.\",\n",
       " \"So Much for so little! A great phone at a great price! where else but amazon could you find a phone that has basic features as well as a mini keyboard at the price that it was offered for. It quality is great, and I haven't had any dropped calls since I've gotten this phone and with taking the net10 $25 prepaid card, 750 is more than enough for someone to use in 30 days, unless you get on the phone stay on forever. Keep up the great work Amazon. Amazon is Amazing!\",\n",
       " \"Solid feature phone I have been with Net10 for 8 months now and I switched from a Bring Your Own Phone SIM card to this Samsung. My unlocked HP Pre 3 messed up and I saw this for only $9.99 FREE PRIME shipping. It was a steal.This phone is exactly what I needed. It has features many basic phones don't have nowadays. Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one. At only $9.99 who wouldn't?\",\n",
       " \"Works just fine This phone works just fine for someone who just needs a phone. I got the 750 minute plan and I have loads of minutes to burn through, so I tried using the browser.

I haven't tried the 411 service yet, but I suspect that will be faster than using the internet. The sound and the ringer are both good. The keyboard works well for me, but the buttons are too small for my husband to use. The battery life is excellent. Good phone for the money.\",\n",
       " 'CDMA New Hampshire for US Cellular people. Works great in New Hampshire. It uses the US Cellular towers (CDMA). Would recommend!

Also, text messages are 1.00 minute for outgoing and receiving. Buttons are small but easy to get used to.

       " 'Excellent Bargain, Terrible Service Rightfully, I should probably give this product one star rather than three, but I’m considering the possibility that I just got a defective cell. I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it’s never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What’s more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10’s website the phone still didn’t work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn’t receive a signal… almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn’t even work at our home whereas we’ve had AT&T and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we’d had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn’t resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they’d send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would’ve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.',\n",

My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong. The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc. All in all, this is not a good phone.\",\n",

This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book. It has a calendar as well as a calculator, it also has a camera, again, this is a prepaid phone camera, don't expect over the top pictures, but they afre not bad at all...for this type of phone. The battery life on this phone is outstanding too. I highly reccomend this phone.\",\n",

I only use it for job/quick calls, I'm not much of a talker so I needed a prepaid phone.I bought a 200min card from NET10 the same day I got it and after a month, i still have 100+ min left. Buying this phone was definitely the right choice because it was cheap and I don't need a plan. It's a very light and has common cellphone features. The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min. It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job. The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok. Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time. I never let it past 2 bars(out of 5) so I don't know how long it truly lasts. (I only remember charging it twice, when 3 bars left, ever since i got it a month ago)\",\n",
       " \"So good, I just ordered another R355C Net10 phone *** UPDATE *** I lost my first one of these 2 days ago. I had it over a year. I researched other Net10 CDMA phones, as I prefer the Verizon network. I also have Net10 LG900g, which is GSM, on ATT. (That is also a good phone, by the way...but Verizon is better in our area). I ordered another one of the R355C, not only because of the price. The phone clarity was great, texting was easy for me, alarm clock worked fine, all the things I really needed it for. It has a good speakerphone. The camera is not that great, because there is no zoom, etc. No extra features. You can't even enlarge it at all when someone sends a pic message. Sometimes you have to ask them what it is a photo of. That is the state of this camera. (the LG900g has a nice camera). The browser, well, it's a browser. Not a smartphone. You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want. It is slow, though, and not a computer experience. But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to. As a phone, as a texter, as an alarm clock, as a calculator, etc., it is wonderful. I was really sad to lose my first one and really happy to find another one here at this price. *** UPDATE **** The first one I received now was DOA. Not sure if battery or phone itself. Ordered a replacement for it, and now this one is shutting itself off after a few minutes. I need to return both. Should I try this model again? I don't know... I loved the one I lost...that is why I ordered another. So disappointing that these 2 replacements are not good. **** Second UPDATE **** The seller has graciously replaced this for me with a new one that works just great. Happy again.\",\n",
       " \"over all good phone but has some annoyances Ive owned this phone a little over a month now and for the most part do not regret buying it at current price, $9. However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do. I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones. The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music. Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo. Speaker is on par with other cheap phones. I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger.\",\n",
       " \"At last, good reception at a reasonable price! I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing. My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us. I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway. A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account. As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these. The menus are well organized, and I use the phone as my daily alarm as well. I like the ringtones selection.\",\n",

First off, the deal is crazy. Less than 25 dollars for this phone! Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter\\'s plan to her actual cell phone usage! Add a cute \"blinged-out\" phone case\\xa0Samsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight Talk\\xa0and a phone charm, and she is in business! Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box? It doesn\\'t support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn\\'t going to need that yet, but it\\'s nice to have, LOL). The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3\\'s for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won\\'t allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we\\'ve had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we\\'re probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls). Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone. Thank you SO MUCH for providing this item for Amazon customers at such a great price! **UPDATE** Just a little tip....it costs 3.5 minutes to send an MMS, so if possible, link your device via Bluetooth and send MMS that way.',\n",

Bluetooth works great with my Mazda, I never have to touch the phone to make/receive calls. Tip, you have to keep it locked, which you can do manually by holding the space key or set autolock.

This phone had great battery life and very good reception. It is very light and has a type of plastic on the sides that will prevent it from easily slipping out of your hand. The MP3 player is nice, but I haven't found any equalizer settings...the sound is still good though. It isn't a smart phone, but is is a great little text phone. The browser works for basic things, like a quick email check. The camera is fine for quick snap shots and seems to do pretty well in average indoor lighting. If you live in a CDMA area with limited GSM service like I do, and you want to go the Net10 route, this is a good phone, especially for the price! There is a newer version of this phone available for Straight Talk (R375c) that has better screen resolution and better web browser capabilities, but I haven't seen it available for Net10. For now, this phone is just fine.\",\n",

This one is set up for a place that has Sprint towers. Being 60 miles from Sacramento and 60 miles from Stockton, the major cell phone tower ill pjhones AT&T. I was going to return it BUT it's almost $7.00 to do a UPS drop-off and $13.00 for UPS to pick it up. I only paid $14.00 so it's not worth sending it back. Therefore I'll either keep it, gift it to someone who lives where the Sprint tower is or donate to a woman's center in the big city.\",\n",

It's easy to download music and just about everything except anything requiring flas player. I only upgraded to android to be able to watch youtube at work.

Best of all, the activation and phone plan I paid for did not get completed because the Tracfone server was too busy.

I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special. It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature.

To keep this as brief as possible and not go on forever (which i truly could) I\\'ll just say that in a single day I was accused of lieing about buying minutes or in this case posting my credit card for \"easy pay\" which it\\'s not ! To having the phone disabled for 2 days, then having my phone number changed 3 times because their supposed simple number transfer process somehow couldn\\'t be accomplished. Their techs had no reason for this until one of them suggested that the number had just expired! i had the same number for 7 years . Strange it expired the minute they tried to transfer it! Then after all is \"fixed\" I try to make a call and i get a Verizon operator telling me i can\\'t call out!! The nightmare goes on and on ! I\\'ll stop here and just say i wouldn\\'t recommend Net 10 to my worst enemy!!!!',\n",

So, this seller obviously sold me a previously activated phone, and wasted my time, since no one could help me activate it.

So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion. The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone. I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy. I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS. Has a way to go. I was able to put it on my home WiFi and link the Bluetooth to my car handsfree system with no trouble at all. For the price, this is a great, functional phone. It isn't the be-all-end-all of phones, but for someone like me who is not a heavy cell phone user, it is delightful. I am very happy with it and I may either use my old Nokia as a backup emergency phone or donate it to those organizations who give phones to soldiers for calling home.\",\n",
       " \"Overall a very good phone. Phone came unlocked and ready to use. I like windows as i find asy to use. This has windows 7.5. It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures. It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked. That if I connect the phone with at&t I would be able to send photos via msn. For the same reason I cannot use the phone's integrated gps. In other words 5 functions that comes with the phone you cannot use them unless you connected with at&t. But you can work your way around it if you just download the right app. I use whatsapp to be able to send pictures and a gps app I downloaded.\",\n",
       " \"Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5 I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.\",\n",
       " \"Good Start If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun. The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now. There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems. I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need. Samsung has a user manual available on their website with many tips and information not available anywhere else. Windowsphonehacker.com has the seveneighter file that I mentioned to update your phone with great help articles as well.\",\n",
       " \"A great travel and backup phone I have owned a Samsung Focus for two and a half years now. It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged. My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon. Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is. The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling. Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples). At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.\",\n",
       " \"Excellent Phone This is a good phone, is really fast and slim. You have the mango update right away after you connected the phone to your computer. The screen is really good. The camera is really nice too, good pictures. Windows Phone 7.5 is really good, you got facebook and twitter integration. The zune marketplace for music and bing search that is really good, you can search for songs even if you don't know the names. Not everything is perfect battery life is only for one day, you have to charge it everyday. You don't have skype and sugarsync apps but they said they are coming soon. The bad part of Windows Phone 7.5 is that you need to integrate the memory card to the file system. Its not hot swap and also you cant transfer files with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process. The The only way to transfer files to the phone is by mail or skydrive. With the Focus you don't get the Hotspot feature. For the user that is in Venezuela you can use the marketplace, i am in El Salvador. You have to configure the phone in the regional settings for USA and also your Hotmail or live account for USA. If can live without the SD card is really a good phone that has really good features and can compete with android or IOS\",\n",
       " 'Disappointed with phone and Microsoft Returned this item for a refund, not only because it was defective, but poorly designed as well (despite what the experts say) and because the Microsoft 30-day free music download appears to be a deliberate scam. As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work. The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work. When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over. The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant. As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7. When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device. When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on. (I eventually discovered that there\\'s a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.) As for that free music trial, I clicked the \"Cancel this subscription\" on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer. No sweat right? Wrong. This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen. After entering your password, MS says it still needs to \"verify\" who you are by sending a code to your email address. After retrieving and entering that, you select \"Account\", only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found. The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn\\'t correspond to the screens you actually see. At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you\\'re not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system. On another screen, you\\'re instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you\\'re instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes. But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn\\'t work and you should try again later. Boy, last time I check, this sort of con game involving interstate commerce was outlawed by the FTC. The only recourse seems to be waiting for the charge to show up on the credit card and disputing it through your bank.',\n",
       " \"Another good samsung product I had this phone for about three years and enjoyed it very much. The flash is VERY bright. It takes good quality pictures when the flash is being used or when you are in a very brightly lit area. But again, the flash is VERY bright. I enjoyed the window's phone setup. I didn't much care for the marketplace. However, the phone itself is a very solid phone. I dropped it in my dog's water bowl..I let it dry out for a while and it worked! However, it was a bit glitchy after that but what do expect when it has been submerged in a bowl of water? I still use it to this day( even though I have a new phone) because its almost like having a very small computer. It was money well spent. If I hadn't dropped it in the water, and it was compatible with Verizon, I would still be using it.\",\n",
       " 'This is the most undervalued phone on Amazon This phone is incredible, and for $100 you\\'re getting a screaming deal. I think the windows phone software is really really nice, and the screen on this phone fits it very well. With an AMOLED screen, black is actually black, so in many respects, the screen beats out even iphone screens. True the resolution is a bit lower, but the infinite contrast ratio is hard to beat. It takes great pictures, it\\'s quick. I just wish I could use google as my default search engine, and I miss Siri sometimes. This phone uses the same bands as the iphone 4. That means that those of you hoping to use it on T-mobile will have 3G in some places, (everywhere T-mobile has \"refarmed\" their towers to work on 1900Mhz.)',\n",
       " \"Highly satisfied... again This is my fourth Samsung Focus. I am not especially careful with phones, so my third issue dropped into a certain bathroom receptacle when I wasn't looking. I am still holding out for a 64gb Nokia Lumia 1020 to become available in the US. Until then, I'm Fine with the Focus. All my replacements have come from Amazon, and this last phone is working as satisfactorily as the first three. I have installed a 32GB SD card again and loaded up 35.9 GB of music, pics, and apps. All my calendar, contacts and mail have synced through my Microsoft account, and all is well again. This phone came through Amazon merchant BREED. They followed up on my Prime two-day shipment with an email, to check that the phone was working well: unusual, in my experience, and appreciated. Thanks Samsung and Amazon again, and BREED this time.\",\n",

It's fast, responsive and the colors are vibrant. It's super easy to use and intuitive. I like the Windows layout. Camera's not bad. I need to play around with it more, but it seems to have a lot of options and the first pic I took came out decent (not bad since the lighting where I took it was mediocre). I was able to connect to the Wifi right away and it accepted my TMobile sim card with no problems at all. I'm really happy with this phone especially for the price I got it for.

Shipping only took 2 days and the packaging was done professionally. -- Love my Samsung Focus.',\n",
       " 'First time unlocked buyer This was my first time buying a \\'unlocked\\' phone on amazon so I was a bit worried. I read that it can use any provider as long as it has a sim card. I use a provider that is local based only so I was somewhat hesitant, but it works like it said it would. It came when the delivery said it would and I\\'ve been fiddling and adding contacts so far. I like how fast it is and it definitely doesn\\'t seem like a \\'older\\' smartphone. It\\'s very sensitive, which I had to get used too. It also doesn\\'t seem like it can break easy and isn\\'t really flimsy. I like the design of it, but I\\'m a bit disappointed that I can\\'t use the AT&T GPS without signing a 10 dollar a month free. That\\'s not really that big of a deal as there\\'s a built in app called \"Maps\\' That does basically the same. It finds your locations very quickly and is basically like a map quest. The Wifi works perfectly as well and it\\'s pretty fast. Overall I\\'m pleasantly surprised and would buy another unlocked phone on here!

       " \"Great Hardware, Good OS, Terrible Market Changed from an iPhone 3G to this, have to admit that Microsoft/Samsung did a great job in the Software/Hardware tandem. This phone is fast, the screen looks amazing and the sound is pretty impressive for a cel phone. The price is affordable and surprising. When you start with Windows Phone 7 is a breeze of fresh air vs other mobile OS, once upgraded to Mango then you gain a lot of features like multitasking, copy/paste and live notifications. The BIG problem here is the Marketplace: The developers are not publishing here at the same rate or quality than iOS or Android...sure, it's a secure Market (due to Microsoft filters) but lacks content. The BIGGEST problem comes when you are not from US (like me) and, in order to be able to purchase apps, need to migrate to a non-US Market...the apps here (worldwide Market) are terrible or non-existent at most, the games are far from decent and Bing maps barely identifies mayor streets on capital cities. These issues needs to addressed by Microsoft ASAP, there is no way they could try to compete with Apple or Google seriously with so much restrictions on app publishing on other Markets. Pros: Cheap Fast Great Screen Mango Update makes the OS shine Lightweight Cons: Marketplace Battery Life\",\n",
